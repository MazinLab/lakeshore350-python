country to country, state to state or province to province.
8.Further, with regard to the United Nations Convention for International Sale of Goods (CISC,) if CISG is found to apply in relation to this
agreement, which is specifically disclaimed by Lake Shore, then this
limited warranty excludes warranties that: (a) the Product is fit for the
purpose for which goods of the same description would ordinarily be
used, (b) the Product is fit for any particular purpose expressly or
impliedly made known to Lake Shore at the time of the conclusion of
the contract. (c) the Product is contained or packaged in a manner
usual for such goods or in a manner adequate to preserve and protect

against any or all damages or costs incurred by you arising from the
infringement of patents or trademarks or violation or copyrights by
the Product.
10.THIS WARRANTY IS NOT TRANSFERRABLE. This warranty is not
transferrable.
11.Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, neither Lake
Shore nor any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or suppliers will be held liable for direct, special, incidental, consequential or other damages
(including lost profit, lost data, or downtime costs) arising out of the
use, inability to use or result of use of the product, whether based in
warranty, contract, tort or other legal theory, regardless whether or
not Lake Shore has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Purchaser's use of the Product is entirely at Purchaser's risk. Some
countries, states and provinces do not allow the exclusion of liability
for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation may
not apply to you.
12.This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may
also have other rights that vary within or between jurisdictions where
the product is purchased and/or used. Some jurisdictions do not allow
limitation in certain warranties, and so the above limitations or exclusions of some warranties stated above may not apply to you.
13.Except to the extent allowed by applicable law, the terms of this
limited warranty statement do not exclude, restrict or modify the
mandatory statutory rights applicable to the sale of the product 
to you.

Director of Quality & Compliance

Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) for the Model 350 Temperature Controller
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of electronic equipment is a growing concern worldwide. Emissions of and
immunity to electromagnetic interference is now part of the design and manufacture of most electronics. To qualify
for the CE Mark, the Model 350 meets or exceeds the requirements of the European EMC Directive 89/336/EEC as a
CLASS A product. A Class A product is allowed to radiate more RF than a Class B product and must include the following warning:
WARNING:This is a Class A product. In a domestic environment, this product may cause radio interference in which
case the user may be required to take adequate measures.
The instrument was tested under normal operating conditions with sensor and interface cables attached. If the
installation and operating instructions in the User's Manual are followed, there should be no degradation in EMC
performance.
This instrument is not intended for use in close proximity to RF Transmitters such as two-way radios and cell
phones. Exposure to RF interference greater than that found in a typical laboratory environment may disturb the
sensitive measurement circuitry of the instrument.
Pay special attention to instrument cabling. Improperly installed cabling may defeat even the best EMC protection.
For the best performance from any precision instrument, follow the grounding and shielding instructions in the
User's Manual. In addition, the installer of the Model 350 should consider the following:
D
D
D
D

Shield measurement and computer interface cables.
Leave no unused or unterminated cables attached to the instrument.
Make cable runs as short and direct as possible. Higher radiated emissions are possible with long cables.
Do not tightly bundle cables that carry different types of signals.

cHAPTER 1: Introduction

In short, the Model 350 cryogenic temperature controller brings a new level of power,
precision, and performance to critical low temperature physics research. It is ideal for
use with He-3 systems, adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators (ADRs), certain dilution refrigerators, and many other applications demanding low thermal power and
high measurement precision.

1.2 Application
Versatility

Designed to support a broad range of sensor types, the Model 350 is performance
optimized for use over the entire temperature range of Cernox™ sensors, making it
the instrument of choice for ULT environments, as well as other cryogenic systems
where errors due to magneto-resistive or radiation effects need to be minimized.

1.2.1 Four Standard
Sensor Input Channels

The Model 350 comes with four standard sensor inputs supporting Cernox™, ruthenium oxide, platinum RTDs, and other NTC RTD sensors. Inputs can be configured to
accept any of the supported input types. Each sensor input channel has its own current source, providing fast settling times. The four sensor inputs are optically isolated
from other circuits to reduce noise and to provide repeatable sensor measurements.
Current reversal eliminates thermal electromotive force (EMF) errors in resistance
sensors. Nine excitation currents facilitate temperature measurement and control
down to 100 mK, with the nominal temperature range (using Cernox™ sensors) spanning to 420 K. The instrument automatically selects the optimal current and gain levels for you once the sensor type is selected, and automatically scales current to
minimize self-heating effects at low temperatures. The patented input circuitry eliminates any errors associated with grounding inconsistencies, making it easier to
achieve reliable measurements at ultra-low temperatures. With the ability to label
each sensor input channel with a customized name, it’s also easy to identify the measured values being displayed.

1.2.2 Three Option
Cards for More Inputs
and a Wider Range of
Applications

Field installable input option cards can expand your sensor selection to include silicon diodes (like DT-670), capacitance sensors or thermocouples. Once installed, the
option input can be selected and named from the front panel like any other input
type. These option cards further expand the application versatility of the Model 350
temperature controller by allowing specialized sensors to be switched in and out to
achieve specific measurement objectives. For example, addition of the thermocouple
input option enables continuous measurement to 1000 K and above. Alternatively,
the capacitance sensor option card enables a magnetics-impervious capacitance
temperature sensor to be temporarily switched in for elimination of magneto-resistive effects while taking low temperature sample measurements under high or
changing fields. Diode sensor support is provided by the 4-channel scanner option
card, which also enables use of additional Cernox™ sensors for supplemental 
monitoring.

1.2.3 Four PID
Controlled Outputs

For convenient integration into a wide range of systems, the Model 350 offers four
PID-controlled outputs. Variable DC current source outputs include a 75 W output for
direct control of the typical main warm-up heater, and a 1 W output for fine control of
the sample heater. Two additional 1 W variable DC voltage source outputs can be
used to power auxiliary devices like a still heater in a dilution refrigerator, or to control a magnet power supply driving an ADR. The ability to dynamically select an input
to associate with the controlled output provides additional flexibility in setting up the
control scheme.

1.2.4 Precision Temperature Control

1.2.4 Precision
Temperature Control

The Model 350 calculates the precise control output based on your temperature setpoint and feedback from the control sensor. You can manually set the PID values for
fine control, or the temperature control loop autotuning feature can automate the
tuning process for you. The setpoint ramp feature provides smooth, continuous setpoint changes and predictable setpoint approaches without the worry of overshoot
or excessive settling times. When combined with the zone setting feature, which
enables automatic switching of sensor inputs and scales current excitation through
ten different preloaded temperature zones, the Model 350 provides continuous measurement and control over the entire temperature range required.

1.3 Simple and
Increased
Productivity

With remote control and automated features, the Model 350 will simplify your temperature control processes and increase your productivity in the laboratory.

1.3.1 Three Interfaces
for Remote Control

The Model 350 temperature controller includes Ethernet, USB, and IEEE-488 interfaces. In addition to gathering data, nearly every function of the instrument can be
controlled through a computer interface. Ethernet provides the ability to access and
monitor instrument activities via the internet from anywhere in the world, allowing
distributed sharing of the controller and the controlled system. You can download the
Lake Shore curve handler software to your computer to easily enter and manipulate
sensor calibration curves for storage in the instrument’s nonvolatile flash memory.

1.3.2 Simple
Automation

Each sensor input has a high and low alarm that offer latching and non-latching operation. The two relays can be used in conjunction with the alarms to alert you of a fault
condition and perform simple on/off control. Relays can be assigned to any alarm or
operated manually. Choosing appropriate PID control settings for a closed loop system can be tedious, but the Model 350 provides the temperature control loop autotuning feature to simplify the process. It’s an automated process that measures
system characteristics and computes setting values for P, I, and D for you. Once PID
tuning parameters are chosen for a given setpoint, the zone tuning feature automatically switches sensor inputs for new setpoints, enabling you to control temperatures
from 100 mK to over 1000 K without interrupting your experiment.

1.4 Performance
You Can Count On

As with all Lake Shore products, the Model 350 product specifications are documented and verifiable in keeping with Lake Shore’s tradition of performance assurance even at application extremes. The product is supported by a 3-year standard
warranty, our confirmation of quality and commitment for the long term. Choosing
the Model 350 for your ultra-low temperature application means you’ll have the ultimate confidence in meeting your integration, measurement and control needs, now
and into the future.

1.4.1 Balanced Current
Source

The Model 350 provides a unique, patented, matched impedance current source as
its first defense against common mode noise. Just as voltage input terminals for a differential input have the same input impedance; the two current source output terminals of the Model 350 have the same source impedance. This matched impedance
ensures that common mode voltages do not become normal mode voltages. With this
strategy, the differential input remains truly differential for accurate resistance measurement.

1.4.2 Common Mode
Reduction Circuit

To further reduce the effect of common mode voltage, the Model 350 includes an
active common mode reduction circuit. This circuit dynamically adjusts the current
source output operation point to minimize common mode voltage at the measurement input. Active common mode reduction allows the Model 350 to operate in environments that would otherwise be difficult to achieve the required measurement.

cHAPTER 1: Introduction

1.4.3 Measurement
Isolation

Optocouplers isolate the analog front end of the Model 350 from digital circuitry and
the instrument chassis. Optical isolation minimizes the effect of digital noise on the
measurement and breaks ground loops.

1.4.4 Configurable
Display

The Model 350 offers a bright, graphic liquid crystal display with an LED backlight
that simultaneously displays up to eight readings. You can show all four loops, all
inputs, or if you need to monitor one input, you can display just that one in greater
detail. Or you can custom configure each display location to suit your experiment.
Data from any input can be assigned to any of the locations, and your choice of temperature or sensor units can be displayed. For added convenience, you can also custom label each sensor input, eliminating the guesswork in remembering or
determining the location to which a sensor input is associated.

FIGURE 1-2 Displays showing four loop mode, input display mode and custom display mode

1.4.5 Use Additional
Input Types with Option
Cards

The field installable input option cards add additional input types. The Model 3060
adds thermocouple capability. The Model 3061 adds capacitance sensor inputs. The
Model 3062 adds 4 Cernox™/platinum/diode input channels. While the option cards
can be easily removed, it is not necessary as the standard inputs remain functional
when the options are not being used.

1.5 Sensor
Selection

Cernox™ thin-film RTDs offer high sensitivity and low magnetic field-induced errors
over the 0.1 K to 420 K temperature range. Cernox™ sensors require calibration.
Platinum RTDs offer high uniform sensitivity from 30 K to over 800 K. With excellent
reproducibility, they are useful as thermometry standards. They follow a standard
curveabove 70 K and are interchangeable in many applications.
Silicon diodes are the best choice for general cryogenic use from 1.4 K to above room
temperature. Silicon diodes are economical to use because they follow a standard
curve and are interchangeable in many applications. They are not suitable for use in
ionizing radiation or magnetic fields.
Capacitance sensors are ideally suited for use in strong magnetic fields because they
exhibit virtually no magnetic field dependence. They can be used from 1.4 K to 290 K.

Chapter 2: Cooling System Design
and Temperature Control
2.1 General

Selecting the proper cryostat or cooling source is probably the most important decision in designing a temperature control system. The cooling source defines minimum
temperature, cool-down time, and cooling power. Information on choosing a cooling
source is beyond the scope of this manual. This chapter provides information on how
to get the best temperature measurement and control from cooling sources with
proper setup including sensor and heater installation.

2.2 Useful
Temperature
Range

The lowest temperature at which the Model 350 can make useful temperature measurements is difficult to define. In a practical sense, the instrument is limited by its
need for four electrically conductive leads to be attached to a sensor and that sensor
attached to a cold surface. Heat conduction and noise pick-up in the sensor leads
limit the lowest temperature that can be achieved in this environment, even before
an instrument is attached. The diminishing thermal contact between the sensor and
cold surface at low temperatures exaggerate the problem. In general, the Model 350
was designed for measurements down to 100 mK.

2.3 Cryogenic
Cooling System
Terminology

There are many different cryogenic cooling systems used in laboratories today and it
would be impossible to describe them all in this manual. This section briefly illustrates the three most common cooling systems capable of reaching temperatures
below 1 K. This is an attempt to demonstrate how the Model 350 can be integrated
into these systems for resistance measurement, temperature measurement and temperature control. It is hoped that from these examples, those knowledgeable in cryogenic techniques will become familiar with the terminology used throughout this
manual and the intended operation of many of the instrument features.

2.3.1 Dilution
Refrigerator
Terminology

Dilution refrigerators remain the workhorse of low temperature research down to
approximately 5 mK to 10 mK. So many variations of factory and home built units
exist that it is unlikely that any two are identical. FIGURE 2-1 illustrates only the
most basic features.

2.4 Model 350
Theory of
Operation

This section explains sensor resistance measurements, excitation modes, resistance
ranges and measurement circuits. It also explains measurement speed and filtering
for the Model 350.

2.4.1 Sensor Resistance
Measurement

The Model 350 uses a four lead, AC square wave measurement technique to achieve
its accuracy with current excitations down to 10 nA.
The Model 350 uses current excitation because controlled current is very stable and
predictable. Current can also be scaled easily, which is necessary to achieve low excitation. The Model 350 has 11 current settings from 1 mA down to 10 nA. These currents have low noise and almost no DC component to self-heat the sensor.
Precision sensor measurements use a four lead method to eliminate the effect of
nominal lead resistance. Excitation current is driven on one pair of leads while the
resulting signal voltage is measured on the second pair. Measurement errors from
lead resistance are proportional to current flowing in the voltage leads. Instrument
voltage inputs are expected to have high impedance to prevent the unwanted current
from flowing. The Model 350 has high input impedance to both normal mode voltages (created by current source excitation) and common mode voltages (created by
induced noise on the leads).
Offset voltages occur in every electronic circuit both in signal amplifiers and in lead
wire connections that create thermal EMF voltages. Offset voltages affect accuracy
more when the excitation is small because they are a larger percentage of the measured voltage. Square wave reversing measurements allow higher amplifier gain and
greater sensitivity than DC techniques.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

2.4.2 Excitation Modes

2.4.2 Excitation Modes

19

The Model 350 uses a low noise current source excitation for sensor measurements.
The instrument firmware is also able to simulate voltage excitation of the measured
sensor to create an autorange mode. The autorange mode is usually preferred
because it conveniently limits the excitation power of NTC sensors as the temperature decreases. There are two autorange modes available (1 mV and 10 mV). Resistance range selection is different for these two voltages. Autorange is available for
both voltage excitations.
2.4.2.1 Autorange Excitation Mode
The user specifies an input voltage range that is a “not-to-exceed” setting for the
instrument. The instrument selects the appropriate current setting that keeps the
voltage across the sensor as high as possible without exceeding the voltage range setting. Current is changed when the resistance range changes to maintain the voltage
limit. The autorange mode is preferred when measuring negative temperature coefficient materials common in cryogenic temperature sensors. With voltage limited,
excitation power in the sensor reduces with lowering temperature (P = V2/R) limiting
the effect of self-heating. In autorange mode the sensor excitation setting is the maximum not the actual voltage.
The autorange algorithm includes a hysteresis band to prevent instability when the
sensor resistance is at a range boundary. It is possible for the instrument to choose a
different excitation current when approaching a value from below than it chooses
when approaching from above. Autorange should not be used when a specific excitation current is critical.
2.4.2.2 Manual Excitation Mode
The user specifies a fixed resistance range, which defines the excitation current. The
instrument selects the appropriate voltage gain for the selected resistance range. The
instrument keeps the current and resistance range constant when a manual range is
selected. In this mode it is easier to calculate the actual power in the sensor (P = I2 × R)
because the true current is displayed alongside the resistance range in the menu.

2.4.3 Resistance
Ranges

The Model 350 has full-scale resistance ranges from 10 ) to 300 k). Most ranges are
available with either a 10 mV or 1 mV excitation. The goal is to use enough excitation
to maintain reasonable accuracy, resolution and settling time without putting too
much heat into the sensor. Usually the 10 mV autorange excitation mode results in
the best performance, but as temperatures decrease, the 1 mV autorange excitation
mode may result in better performance by limiting the self-heating of the sensor. As
temperatures further decrease, the manual excitation mode may be required to
achieve the optimal performance.
The autorange feature of the Model 350 will increase the resistance range any time
the sensor resistance is greater than full scale for the range, and it will decrease the
range any time the measured resistance is below 20% of full scale. The manual excitation mode allows the user to choose the excitation current, and the instrument
does not change ranges automatically.

2.4.4 Measurement
Circuit

Small signal measurement instruments require special consideration during installation. The following sections illustrate how to treat the instrument and its environment as a measurement circuit and in general how to integrate instruments like the
Model 350. The circuit analogy is appropriate because almost anything electrical or
electronic in a laboratory has the potential to induce electric field (E-field) or magnetic field (H-field) noise on the measurement.

20

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

Since electrical noise is everywhere it is better to begin each installation with a good
instrumentation strategy than it is to deal with noise after measurements are compromised. Most parts of a good strategy are obvious, some are not and even the best
plans do not work all the time. The Model 350 offers several features that help control
noise and maintain signal integrity. Specific recommendations on installation and
lead wiring are given in Chapter 3.
2.4.4.1 Shielding and Grounding Theory
Begin any installation by separating noise sources from their targets. Sources of Efield and H-field noise can be just about anything, but the targets are most often signal leads and other wires and cables. H-field coupling can be dramatically reduced
with an inch or less of separation. E-field noise requires more separation but is also
more easily shielded.
The best defense against E-field noise is a conductive shield around the measurement. The more complete the shield the better. Ideally it should extend from the
instrument measurement circuits through the cables and down to the sensor. This
ideal approach is impractical in all but a few cryogenic systems. The practical
approach is to connect the shield from the measurement circuits, through the room
temperature cables, to the conductive Dewar or vacuum chamber. This creates a faraday shield around the entire measurement circuit.
If the shield or any other part of the measurement circuit is connected to Earth
ground it is necessary to prevent ground loops that couple line frequency noise into
the measurement. A ground loop is created when measurement common is tied to
Earth ground at more than one point. The isolation of the instrument breaks the loop
between the instrument power cord and the measurement common. No loop is
formed if measurement common is tied to Earth ground at only one point.
Loops are also the primary means of coupling H-field noise. Conductive shields do not
reduce the effects of H-fields. Two ways to minimize H-field coupling are to reduce
the loop area or break the loop (as described with ground loops). Loop area can be
minimized by tightly twisting lead pairs, both voltage and current, within the
shielded cables. This reduces loop area and exposes both leads to the same common
mode effects which are rejected by the measurement input.
2.4.4.2 Shields
Shields provide a low impedance path to measurement common to block E-field
noise from getting to the signal leads. Shield pins are provided in the input connectors
as attachment points for the shield conductors in lead cables. Shielding individual
leads inside a cryostat is difficult because of limited space and the potential for heat
leak. Cable shields are usually connected to the experimental Dewar to create a faraday shield around the measurement.
2.4.4.3 Electrical Isolation
The precision analog front end is electrically isolated from digital circuitry and chassis
of the instrument by optocouplers. This can improve measurements in two ways.
First, isolation makes it more difficult for digital noise from control circuits and computer interfaces to affect the measurement leads. Second, isolation separates the
instrument measurement from Earth ground to break potential ground loops.

2.4.5 Measurement Speed and Filtering

21

2.4.4.4 Active Common Mode Reduction
It is common for precision measurement equipment to use a differential input as the
first stage of signal conditioning. The differential input offers high impedance on both
input voltage terminals to reduce the effect of common mode voltage (voltage that
acts on both leads at the same time). Common mode voltage can come from many
sources including external noise coupling into the lead wires and the instrument’s
own current source. To reduce the effect of common mode voltage further the
Model 350 includes an active common mode reduction circuit. This circuit dynamically adjusts the operation point of the current source output to minimize the common mode voltage seen at the measurement input.
2.4.4.5 Matched Impedance Current Source
The two current source output terminals on the Model 350 have the same source
impedance, similar to the voltage input terminals of a differential input that have the
same input impedance. The sensor being measured and all noise sources in the environment “see” the same impedance on both current source leads when looking back
into the instrument. Traditional current sources with different impedance on each
lead (one lead grounded) can lessen the common mode rejection of a differential
input especially when measuring sensors with large resistances. The common mode
noise sources have the same effect on both sides of the sensor being measured ensuring that common mode voltages are not turned into normal mode voltages (voltages
are present between measurement leads).

2.4.5 Measurement
Speed and Filtering

The Model 350 has a built in hardware low-pass filter with a -3dB frequency of 16 Hz.
Additional filtering is done in the instrument firmware as a linear average.
The input hardware settles about 100 milliseconds after a temperature (sensor resistance) change if no range change is required. When the firmware filter is turned on,
that filter settling time must be added to the hardware settling time to approximate
overall settling. The firmware filter can be set from 2 point to 64 points. 
See section 4.4.10 for more details.
Range change requires additional settling because the internal circuits need time to
reestablish their operating point.
The instruments A/D sampling (update) rate is 10 readings per second and all readings are available over the computer interface. This rate allows the A/D to capture any
sensor changes that are able to pass through the input hardware. The temperature
control loop, analog voltage outputs and max/min capture are updated with each A/D
reading.

2.5 Noise Sources

The effect of electrical noise is usually small and can be ignored when making routine
measurements but noise can become important when measuring low temperatures.
The following paragraphs describe the most common noise source encountered with
small signal measurements and some techniques that can help reduce their effect.
More specific installation instructions are given in Chapter 3.

2.5.1 Induced Electrical
Noise

Noise from the environment is typically classified as either electric field (E-field) or
magnetic field (H-field). E-field noise capacitively couples into measurement leads or
the sensor being measured. Voltage is induced on the leads as if the noise source and
lead are two halves of a capacitor. The amount of coupling is related to the voltage
change at the source, the common area between source and receiver (length of lead)
and dielectric0 between them (distance in air). A cable shield is the first line of
defense against E-field noise.

| www.lakeshore.com

22

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

No measurement cable of any length should be run from the Model 350 without a shield.
The shield provides a low impedance path to measurement common that prevents the
voltage change at the source from being seen at the measurement leads.

H-field noise inductively couples into measurement leads or other conductive loops.
Current is induced in the lead as if the noise source and lead are two halves of a transformer. The amount of coupling is related to the field change from the source and the
loop area. Tightly twisted leads inside the shielded cable reduce the total loop area
and minimize the effect of H-field noise. It is also effective to move the instrument
and leads away from noise sources because field strength reduces by the inverse cube
of distance.
Even with proper installation it is impossible to eliminate induced noise. High resistance ranges are affected more because the leads create a more efficient antenna
when they are terminated at a high resistance.

2.5.2 Ground Loop
Noise

Ground loops produce noise that acts similar to induced noise but the cause of the
noise is different. Current is generated in any conductive circuit or loop when that
loop contains changing current or magnetic field. In measurements this problem is
commonly referred to as a ground loop and generally results when improperly
grounded instruments are exposed to AC line current. Isolation reduces ground loop
noise by breaking the loop or circuit. The Model 350 has a well-designed power supply and uses optical isolation between the instrument chassis and measurement circuits. Careful installation is necessary to take advantage of the isolation.

2.5.3 Analog Circuit
Noise

The current source and amplifiers inside the Model 350 make a contribution to measurement noise. Circuits were carefully chosen to maintain good noise performance
over a wide resistance range without generating high leakage currents that could
self-heat sensors. Instrument noise, specified in TABLE 1-3, is dominated by amplifier
noise. When high resistance sensors (>10 k)) are measured the noise measured
becomes dominated by the thermal noise of the resistance. The thermal noise of a
sensor drops as the temperature is reduced, and at low temperatures the sensor thermal noise becomes negligible, so high resistance sensors at low temperatures are not
impacted by the sensor thermal noise. The instrument noise (measurement resolution) listed in TABLE 1-3 was verified with a sensor cooled to 4.2 K, so that the resulting instrument noise best fits what will be seen in an actual measurement. Noise
measurements of high value resistances at room temperature will be significantly
higher than the noise measured at low temperatures.

2.5.4 Digital Circuit
Noise

All digitally controlled instruments emit some high-frequency noise both through the
air and on their leads. Emission from a Model 350 is very low and will not affect sensor measurements if the instrument is installed properly. The high frequency noise
can interfere with very sensitive measurements being made in the same Dewar. Interference can be minimized by separating the instruments and their leads outside the
Dewar and placing ferrite beads on the Model 350 measurement leads, near the
Dewar, to stop the noise from getting inside. Wrapping leads through the large beads
more than one time improves their attenuation of unwanted signals. Lake Shore sells
a clamp on ferrite bead as part number 2071.
A more common source of digital noise than the instrument itself is digital computers
used for data acquisition. Computers with their high clock speeds generate a wide
spectrum of noise and transmit it through line cords and interface cables. Isolation in
the Model 350 separates the measurement circuits from interface circuits but computers must still be treated carefully during installation of a system.

2.5.5 Resistor Thermal Noise

2.5.5 Resistor Thermal
Noise

23

Thermal noise or Johnson noise is the most common noise associated with resistors.
This noise is present in all resistors, is independent of excitation and has a flat frequency spectrum. The equation for Johnson noise is often expressed as
Vnoise = (4kTR,f)1/2
where Vnoise is the RMS noise voltage, k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10-23 J/K), T
is temperature in Kelvin and ,f is the noise bandwidth in Hz. Some considerations
when using the equation, peak to peak noise will be within 5 times RMS noise more
than 99% of the time, ,f can be calculated several ways and a common method is 
('/2) f3db where f3db is the 3 dB bandwidth of the dominant low-pass filter in the
measuring circuit. As a practical example, the noise voltage of a 100 k) resistor at
room temperature using a 1 second filter is approximately 16 nV RMS or 80 nV PP.
When the resistor is cooled the thermal noise drops accordingly.
Thermal noise is normally the biggest noise source in higher value resistors being measured at room temperature.

2.5.6 Vibration Noise

Noise can be generated in lead cables when they are moved or vibrated. This noise
can be related to the triboelectric effect or changes in capacitance between conductors in the cable. Cables carrying small signals should be fastened down without putting strain on the connections.

2.6 Measurement
Error

This section explains warm up and temperature drift, sensor installation and sensor
self-heating and thermal resistance.

2.6.1 Warm Up and
Temperature Drift

When the Model 350 is first turned on, it should be allowed to warm up for at least
30 mins before use to allow its internal temperature to stabilize. Warm up is an exaggerated form of temperature drift because the temperature change inside the enclosure is larger and faster than would be experienced in a laboratory setting.
Temperature drift, change in reading with change in ambient temperature, is small in
the Model 350 and seldom a significant factor in absolute accuracy. Measurement
repeatability is often dominated by temperature drift and temperature change
should be considered if the instrument is being installed in a rack. If possible, precision measurement instruments should not be placed in the same rack with large
power supplies or other equipment that can change the rack temperature quickly.
Instrument racks should be well ventilated to prevent the buildup of heat.

2.6.2 Sensor
Installation

Installation is an important part of measurements at cryogenic temperatures. The
measured sensor must be at the temperature of its surroundings for the measurement to be valid. Some installation suggestions for temperature sensors are given in
section 3.5.

2.6.3 Sensor SelfHeating and Thermal
Resistance

A sensor self-heats when the electrical power being put into the measured sensor
resistance is large enough to warm the sensor above the temperature of its surroundings. Electrical power gets into the sensor from both the necessary excitation current
and undesirable noise. Errors from self-heating are dangerous because they can easily go undetected. One strategy for detecting these errors is to understand the thermal resistance of the sensor and predict its reaction to excitation and noise.
Self-heating (,TSH) is a product of the sensor thermal resistance (Rt) expressed in kelvin per watt (K/W) and excitation power (Ps) expressed in watts. ,TSH = Rt Ps; Ps can be
calculated as excitation current squared times measured resistance (Re) Ps = I2Re.

24

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

Section 1.5 includes typical sensor characteristics for Cernox™, Germanium, Ruthenium Oxide RTD’s at 100 mK. Estimates of the thermal resistance of typical sensors
are used to demonstrate how excitation current must be reduced to compensate for
the increase in thermal resistance at lower temperature. Otherwise self-heating
could become a significant part of the overall accuracy. Calculations like this are difficult to do for two reasons, first, manufactures do not always publish specifications on
thermal resistance and second, the actual thermal resistance is very dependent on
installation. An explanation of how to calculate thermal resistance of a temperature
sensor is given in the Lake Shore Temperature Measurement and Control Catalog,
Appendix A.
With an estimate of thermal resistance, the effect of increased excitation current can
be predicted. If self-heating behavior does not match the prediction, noise power may
be high enough to heat the sensor.

2.6.4 Lead Resistance

Measurement leads in cryogenic systems routinely have resistance of tens or even
hundreds of ohms. Lead wire is chosen for its thermal properties first and electrical
resistance is a secondary consideration. The Model 350 measurement circuits can
tolerate significant lead resistance without measurement error. This lead resistance
will give a measurement error that is small compared to the specified accuracy on the
sensor range and in most cases the error is not measurable.

2.7 Operating
Trade-Offs

Any measurement must be optimized to provide the best practical result and tradeoffs must be made to favor the most important measurement characteristics. Some
of the common trade-offs of low temperature measurement are described below.

2.7.1 Sensor 
Self-Heating versus
Excitation

Even after leads are properly heat sunk and noise is effectively shielded, there can be a
temperature error in sensor measurements that comes from within. Self-heating will
occur when the power from excitation current is large enough to warm the sensor
above the temperature of its surroundings. The effect is most noticeable at low temperatures because the thermal conduction becomes very poor. The self-heating error
can be determined by either calculating the error using the thermal resistance of the
sensor or by lowering the excitation current until self-heating does not cause change
in measured resistance.
To measure the effect of self-heating use the current ranges available in the Model
350. Begin by cooling the sensor to the desired temperature and measure its value
using the highest current excitation available for the sensor being measured. Step up
one resistance range (dropping the current by about 2/3) and measure the sensor
resistance again. A change in measured value indicates self-heating was present on
the higher current range. Continue increasing the resistance range (decreasing the
current) until the change is no longer significant. If there is still a measured change at
the lowest current setting, then a different sensor may need to be chosen. A variety of
sensor packages and typical resistances are available, so a sensor with a lower typical
resistance or more thermal resistance at the desired temperature may be required.
Thermal resistance changes with temperature so this process must be repeated at
several temperatures.

2.7.2 Excitation vs.
Signal-to-Noise

Model 350 Temperature Controller

Not everyone uses the lowest excitation range available. This is due to noise, or more
appropriately signal to noise. Noise from a variety of sources affects the small signals
used to make measurements. Lowering excitation makes the signals even smaller but
unfortunately doesn't decrease the noise. Even with careful installation noise effects
cannot be eliminated. The goal of most low temperature measurements is to choose
an excitation that is the best compromise between self-heating and signal to noise.

2.7.3 Considerations When Measuring Ultra-Low Temperatures Below 300 mK

2.7.3 Considerations
When Measuring UltraLow Temperatures
Below 300 mK

25

Temperature measurement becomes more difficult as temperatures approach the
bottom of the Model 350’s measurement range. When measuring temperatures
down to about 300 mK, the 1 mV autorange setting usually results in excellent performance. At even lower temperatures you may have to manually select a current
range to minimize measurement errors. Measurement errors come from self-heating,
instrument resolution (noise), instrument uncertainty, and sensor calibration 
uncertainty.
When measuring a sensor, a user should choose the highest excitation current possible without causing significant self-heating in the sensor. Higher current results in
the largest signal which creates the best signal to noise ratio and gives the highest
instrument accuracy. As the temperature approaches 100 mK, self-heating, via I2*R
Joule heating, begins to dominate overall measurement uncertainty.
There are several ways to decrease self-heating such as increasing the sensor's thermal transfer, selecting a sensor with lower resistance (lower power dissipation), and
reducing the excitation current (by changing the instrument range). Many times, the
sensor thermal characteristics are defined by the type of sensor selected and cannot
be changed. Magnetic fields, sensitivity requirements, noise performance, mounting
considerations, cost, and availability may drive a sensor selection. Once a sensor is
selected, the excitation current should be chosen to balance errors from self-heating
and other sources of resolution, and uncertainty.
Self-heating calculations are explained in section 2.x.x. For a typical CX-1010 at
100 mK with electronic resistance (Re) equal to 21,389), the thermal resistance (Rt)
is 2E+9) (see Appendix E: Temperature Measurement System in the Temperature
Control Catolog). At 10 nA excitation current, the typical self-heating error would be
,TSH = I2ReRt = 10 nA2 * 21,389 * 2E+9 = +4.3mK.
Instrument electronic accuracy can be calculated from the specifications listed in
TABLE 1-3. The accuracy depends on the range selected and the sensor reading, 
TABLE 1-3 lists this as a reading and range error (such as ±100 )±0.04% rdg for NTC
RTD 1mV, 0 ) to 100 k) input range, 10nA excitation current). The accuracy in ohms
can then be converted to temperature using the sensitivity of the sensor being used.
For instance, if a typical Cernox™ CX-1010 is used at 100 mK and 10 nA drive, the
instrument electronic accuracy would be ±100 ) ±0.04% * 21,389 ) or ±108.6 ).
This can then be converted to temperature by using the typical sensitivity at 100 mK
(-558,110 )/K), ±108.6 ) ÷ -558,110 )/K = ±0.2 mK.
The sensor calibration uncertainty is usually listed on the sensor’s data sheet. For the
CX-1010 at 100 mK, the uncertainty is ±4 mK. Contact Lake Shore for more information concerning the uncertainties surrounding calibration, drift, and other sources of
error that determine the uncertainties associated with the sensor.
The total measurement uncertainty is the sum of the self-heating offset error ±
instrument accuracy ± sensor calibration uncertainty. For a typical CX-1010 sensor
driven with 10 nA current at 100 mK, the total uncertainty is
+4.3 mK ± 0.2 mK ± 4 mK = +4.3 mK ± (0.2 mK + 4 mK).
This total uncertainty can be calculated for other excitation currents and other sensors, which may result in different uncertainties. Note that in this analysis, these
uncertainties are simply added together; another common method of adding uncertainties is to add the sum of squares method. Either method of combining uncertainties will illustrate the errors used to evaluate the various sensors and excitation
currents.

26

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

Once the total uncertainty is calculated, the noise or instrument measurement resolution can be factored in. The instrument noise is calculated using the measurement
resolution listed in TABLE 1-3. The temperature equivalent noise is calculated by
dividing the measurement resolution by the sensor’s sensitivity at the temperature of
interest. For a typical CX-1010 at 100 mK the measurement resolution from 
TABLE 1-3 is listed at 10 ). This results in 18 µK of noise (10 ) ÷ 558,110 )/K = 18 µK).
Knowing the noise and uncertainties of the sensors at different excitations can help
in the selection and design of the overall measurement.
Note that in TABLE 2-1, the self-heating is only a rough estimate as the thermal resistance, electrical resistance, and sensitivity are all strong, nonlinear functions of temperature and will change rapidly as you self-heat away from the zero power
resistance. Conversely, self-heating is a reproducible error; so, if self-heating can be
accurately calculated or measured, the self-heating offset can be calibrated out.
The optimum excitation is a balance between minimizing self-heating errors (low
excitation) and maximizing resolution and accuracy (large excitation). TABLE 2-1
illustrates the tradeoffs that need to be made when selecting a sensor and excitation
current. Lowering excitation current can dramatically decrease the error due to selfheating, but sometimes reducing the current can actually increase the overall uncertainty of the measurement.
As seen in TABLE 2-1, the best uncertainty varies among the three sensors and their
corresponding excitation ranges. The best values are shaded to guide the eye. The CX1010 has a high self-heating error at 30 nA, so it is likely that a lower current will be
preferable. The GR-50 sensor can be driven with up to 300 nA, but lower currents significantly reduce the self-heating. The GR-50’s total uncertainty drops to its lowest
level at 30 nA, but if the excitation is further reduced to 10 nA the total uncertainty
increases due to the contribution of the instrument accuracy. The RX-102B illustrates
the tradeoff even clearer; the total uncertainty almost doubles from 30 nA to 10 nA.

TABLE 2-1 Ultra-low temperature considerations

To determine the optimal excitation current, consider that self-heating can be calibrated out. An estimate of the self-heating can be attained either through analysis or
by experimentation. The sensor’s calibration uncertainty remains constant at a particular temperature; therefore, as excitation currents are reduced, the change in
reading is due to self-heating and instrument accuracy (which is range dependent). If
the self-heating is accurately known, then higher excitations (with the reading
adjusted for self-heating) may be better.
As previously stated, another important trade-off is instrument measurement noise.
In TABLE 2-1, instrument noise is not a dominate factor in the total uncertainty, but is
a factor in temperature stability. Many times the speed of measurement is important,
and long averages are impractical; therefore, if keeping the temperature constant is
more important than knowing the exact temperature then higher excitation currents
may be best for a particular experiment. Increasing signal to noise can also be important when dealing with other sources of noise such as, cooling system noise, sensor
thermal noise, vibration noise, and induced electrical noise.

2.8 Temperature
Sensor Selection

This section attempts to answer some of the basic questions concerning temperature
sensor selection. Additional useful information on temperature sensor selection is
available in the Lake Shore Temperature Measurement and Control Catalog. The catalog has a large reference section that includes sensor characteristics and sensor
selection criteria.

2.8.1 Temperature
Range

You must consider several important sensor parameters when choosing a sensor. The
first is experimental temperature range. Some sensors can be damaged by temperatures that are either too high or too low. Manufacturer recommendations should
always be followed.
Sensor sensitivity changes with temperature and can limit the useful range of a sensor. It is important not to specify a range larger than necessary. If you perform an
experiment at liquid helium temperature, a very high sensitivity is needed for good
measurement resolution at that temperature. That same resolution may not be
required to monitor warm up to room temperature. Two different sensors may be
required to tightly cover the range from base temperature to room temperature, but
lowering the resolution requirement on warm up may allow a less expensive, 
1 sensor solution.
Another thing to consider when choosing a temperature sensor is that instruments
like the Model 350 are not able to read some sensors over their entire temperature
range. Lake Shore sells calibrated sensors that operate down to 20 millikelvin (mK),
but the Model 350 is limited to above 100 mK in its standard configuration.

2.8.2 Sensor Sensitivity

Temperature sensor sensitivity is a measure of how much a sensor signal changes
when the temperature changes. It is an important sensor characteristic because so
many measurement parameters are related to it. Resolution, accuracy, noise floor,
and even control stability depend on sensitivity. Many sensors have different sensitivities at different temperatures. For example, a platinum sensor has good sensitivity at
higher temperatures, but it has limited use below 30 K because its sensitivity drops
sharply. It is difficult to determine if a sensor has adequate sensitivity over the experimental temperature range. This manual has specifications (section 1.3) that include
sensor sensitivity translated into temperature resolution and accuracy at different
points. This is typical sensor response and can be used as a guide when choosing a
sensor to be used with the Model 350.

2.8.3 Environmental
Conditions

The experimental environment is also important when choosing a sensor. Environmental factors such as high vacuum, magnetic field, corrosive chemicals, or even
radiation can limit the use of some types of sensors. Lake Shore has devoted much
time to developing sensor packages that withstand the temperatures, vacuum levels,
and bonding materials found in typical cryogenic cooling systems.
Experiments done in magnetic fields are very common. Field dependence of temperature sensors is an important selection criteria for sensors used in these experiments.
This manual briefly qualifies the field dependence of most common sensors in the
specifications (section 1.6). Detailed field dependence tables are included in the
Lake Shore Temperature Measurement and Control Catalog. When available, specific
data on other environmental factors is also included in the catalog.

2.8.4 Measurement
Accuracy

Model 350 Temperature Controller

Temperature measurements have several sources of uncertainty that reduce accuracy. Be sure to account for errors induced by both the sensor and the instrumentation when computing accuracy. The instrument has measurement error in reading
the sensor signal, and error in calculating a temperature using a temperature
response curve. Error results when the sensor is compared to a calibration standard
and the temperature response of a sensor will shift with time and with repeated 

2.8.5 Sensor Package

29

thermal cycling (from very cold temperatures to room temperature). Instrument and
sensor manufacturers specify these errors, but there are things you can do to maintain good accuracy. For example, choose a sensor that has good sensitivity in the most
critical temperature range, as sensitivity can minimize the effect of most error
sources. Install the sensor properly following guidelines in section 2.10. Calibrate the
sensor and instrument periodically, or in some other way null the time dependent
errors. Use a sensor calibration that is appropriate for the accuracy requirement.

2.8.5 Sensor Package

There are different packages for the various types of sensors. Some types of sensors
can even be purchased as bare chips without any package. A sensor package generally
determines its size, thermal and electrical contact to the outside, and sometimes limits temperature range. When different packages are available for a sensor, you should
consider the mounting surface for the sensor and how the leads will be thermally
anchored when choosing.

2.9 Sensor
Calibrations

It can sometimes be confusing to choose the right sensor, get it calibrated, translate
the calibration data into a temperature response curve that the Model 350 can
understand, and then load the curve into the instrument. Lake Shore provides a variety of calibration services to fit different accuracy requirements and budgets.

TABLE 2-2 Sensor diode sensor calibrations

2.9.1 Precision
Calibration

To calibrate, Lake Shore compares a sensor with an unknown temperature response
to an accepted standard. Lake Shore temperature standards are traceable to the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) or the National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain. These standards allow Lake Shore to calibrate sensors from
20 mK to above room temperature. Calibrated sensors are more expensive than
uncalibrated sensors of the same type because of the labor, cryogen use, and capitol
equipment used in the process.
Precision calibration provides the most accurate temperature sensors available from
Lake Shore. Uncertainty from sensor calibration is almost always smaller than the
error contributed by the Model 350. The Lake Shore Temperature Measurement and
Control Catalog has complete accuracy specifications for calibrated sensors.
Calibrated sensors include the measured test data printed and plotted, the coefficients of a Chebychev polynomial that have been fitted to the data, and two tables of
data points to be used as interpolation tables. Both interpolation tables are optimized to allow accurate temperature conversion. The smaller table, called a breakpoint interpolation table, is sized to fit into instruments like the Model 350 where it is
called a temperature response curve.

30

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

It is important to look at instrument specifications before ordering calibrated sensors. A calibrated sensor is required when a sensor does not follow a standard curve if
you wish to display in temperature. Otherwise the Model 350 will operate in sensor
units like ohms or volts. The Model 350 may not work over the full temperature range
of some sensors. The standard inputs are limited to operation above 100 mK even
with sensors that can be calibrated to 20 mK.

2.9.2 SoftCal™

SoftCal™ is a good solution for applications that do not require the accuracy of a precision calibration. The SoftCal™ algorithm uses the well-behaved nature of sensors
that follow a standard curve to improve the accuracy of individual sensors. A few
known temperature points are required to perform SoftCal™. The Model 350 can also
perform a SoftCal™ calibration. You need to provide one, two, or three known temperature reference points. The range and accuracy of the calibration is based on these
points (section 5.10).
Lake Shore offers two or three point SoftCal™ calibrated sensors that include both
the large interpolation table and the smaller breakpoint interpolation table for 400
series diode and Platinum sensors.

2.9.3 Sensors Using
Standard Curves

Some types of sensors behave in a very predictable manner and a standard temperature response curve can be created for them. Standard curves are a convenient and
inexpensive way to get reasonable temperature accuracy. Sensors that have a standard curve are often used when interchangeability is important. Some individual sensors are selected for their ability to match a published standard curve, but in general
these sensors do not provide the accuracy of a calibrated sensor. For convenience, the
Model 350 has several standard curves included in firmware.

2.9.4 Curve Handler™

Lake Shore provides a software application, called Curve Handler™, which makes
loading temperature curves into the Model 350 a very simple process. The program
can copy curves from properly formatted files into the Model 350 user curve locations. You can also use it to read curves from the Model 350 and save them to files.
Lake Shore calibrated sensors are provided with a CD containing all the proper formats to load curves using the Curve Handler™ software program.
There are two versions of the Curve Handler™ application. The fully featured version
is a 32-bit Microsoft Windows™ application that must be installed on a Windows™
PC. This version works with the IEEE-488 and USB computer interfaces on the
Model 350, and allows you to manipulate the temperature curves directly in the program window. This version will also work with all existing Lake Shore temperature
controller and temperature monitor instruments. The Windows™ version of the 
Curve Handler™ application is available, free of charge, from the Lake Shore website
at www.lakeshore.com.
The second version of Curve Handler™ is written in the Java™ programming language
and is available through the Ethernet web interface on the Model 350. This version
allows you to copy curves from files to the Model 350, and vice versa, but it does not
allow manipulation of curve data and only works using the Ethernet interface. Refer
to section 6.4.4 for details on connecting to the web interface and opening the
embedded Curve Handler™ application.

2.10.1 Mounting Materials

31

2.10 Sensor
Installation

This section highlights some of the important elements of proper sensor installation.
For more detailed information, Lake Shore sensors are shipped with installation
instructions that cover that specific sensor type and package. The Lake Shore Temperature Measurement and Control Catalog includes an installation section as well.
To further help you properly install sensors, Lake Shore offers a line of cryogenic
accessories. Many of the materials discussed are available through Lake Shore and
can be ordered with sensors or instruments.

2.10.1 Mounting
Materials

Choosing appropriate mounting materials is very important in a cryogenic environment. The high vacuum used to insulate cryostats is one consideration. Materials
used in these applications should have a low vapor pressure so they do not evaporate
or out-gas and spoil the vacuum insulation. Metals and ceramics do not have this
problem, but greases and varnishes must be checked. Another consideration is the
wide extremes in temperature most sensors are exposed to. The linear expansion
coefficient of materials becomes important when temperature changes are large.
Never try to permanently bond materials with linear expansion coefficients that differ by more than three. Use a flexible mounting scheme or the parts will break apart,
potentially damaging them. The thermal expansion or contraction of rigid clamps or
holders could crush fragile samples or sensors that do not have the same coefficient.
Thermal conductivity is a property of materials that can change with temperature. Do
not assume that a thermal anchor grease that works well at room temperature and
above will do the same job at low temperatures.

2.10.2 Sensor Location

Finding a good place to mount a sensor in an already crowded cryostat is never easy.
There are fewer problems if the entire load and sample holder are at the same temperature. Unfortunately, this not the case in many systems. Temperature gradients
(differences in temperature) exist because there is seldom perfect balance between
the cooling source and heat sources. Even in a well-controlled system, unwanted heat
sources like thermal radiation and heat conducting through mounting structures can
cause gradients. For best accuracy, position sensors near the sample, so that little or
no heat flows between the sample and sensor. This may not, however, be the best
location for temperature control as discussed below.

2.10.3 Thermal
Conductivity

The ability of heat to flow through a material is called thermal conductivity. Good
thermal conductivity is important in any part of a cryogenic system that is intended
to be the same temperature. Copper and aluminum are examples of metals that have
good thermal conductivity, while stainless steel does not. Non-metallic, electricallyinsulating materials like alumina oxide and similar ceramics have good thermal conductivity, while G-10 epoxy-impregnated fiberglass does not. Sensor packages, cooling loads, and sample holders should have good thermal conductivity to reduce
temperature gradients. Surprisingly, the connections between thermally conductive
mounting surfaces often have very poor thermal conductivity (refer to section 2.10.4
and section 2.10.5).

2.10.4 Contact Area

Thermal contact area greatly affects thermal conduction because a larger area has
more opportunity to transfer heat. Even when the size of a sensor package is fixed,
thermal contact area can be improved with the use of a gasket material like indium
foil and cryogenic grease. A soft gasket material forms into the rough mating surface
to increase the area of the two surfaces that are in contact. Good gasket materials are
soft, thin, and have good thermal conductivity. They must also withstand the environmental extremes. Indium foil and cryogenic grease are good examples.

2.10.5 Contact
Pressure

Model 350 Temperature Controller

When sensors are permanently mounted, the solder or epoxy used to hold the sensor
act as both gasket and adhesive. Permanent mounting is not a good solution for
everyone because it limits flexibility and can potentially damage sensors. Much care
should be taken not to over heat or mechanically stress sensor packages. Less permanent mountings require some pressure to hold the sensor to its mounting surface.
Pressure greatly improves the action of gasket material to increase thermal conductivity and reduce thermal gradients. A spring clamp is recommended so that different
rates of thermal expansion do not increase or decrease pressure with temperature
change.

2.10.6 Lead Wire

2.10.6 Lead Wire

33

Different types of sensors come with different types and lengths of electrical leads. In
general a significant length of lead wire must be added to the sensor for proper thermal anchoring and connecting to a bulk head connector at the vacuum boundary. The
lead wire must be a good electrical conductor, but should not be a good thermal conductor, or heat will transfer down the leads and change the temperature reading of
the sensor. Small 30 AWG to 40 AWG wire made of an alloy like phosphor bronze is
much better than copper wire. Thin wire insulation is preferred, and twisted wire
should be used to reduce the effect of RF noise if it is present. The wire used on the
room temperature side of the vacuum boundary is not critical, so copper cable is 
normally used.

2.10.7 Lead Soldering

When you solder additional wire to short sensor leads, be careful not to overheat the
sensor. A thermal anchor such as a metal wire clamp or alligator clip will anchor the
leads and protect the sensor. Leads should be tinned before bonding to reduce the
time that heat is applied to the sensor lead. Clean the solder flux after soldering to
prevent corrosion or outgassing in vacuum.

34

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

2.10.8 Thermal
Anchoring Leads

Sensor leads can be a significant source of error if they are not properly anchored.
Heat will transfer down even small leads and alter the sensor reading. The goal of
thermal anchoring is to cool the leads to a temperature as close to the sensor as possible. This can be accomplished by putting a significant length of lead wire in thermal
contact with every cooled surface between room temperature and the sensor. You
can adhere lead wires to cold surfaces with varnish over a thin electrical insulator like
cigarette paper. They can also be wound onto a bobbin that is firmly attached to the
cold surface. Some sensor packages include a thermal anchor bobbin and wrapped
lead wires to simplify thermal anchoring.

2.10.9 Thermal
Radiation

Thermal (black body) radiation is one of the ways heat is transferred. Warm surfaces
radiate heat to cold surfaces even through a vacuum. The difference in temperature
between the surfaces is one thing that determines how much heat is transferred.
Thermal radiation causes thermal gradients and reduces measurement accuracy.
Many cooling systems include a radiation shield. The purpose of the shield is to surround the sample stage, sample, and sensor with a surface that is at or near their temperature to minimize radiation. The shield is exposed to the room temperature
surface of the vacuum shroud on its outer surface, so some cooling power must be
directed to the shield to keep it near the load temperature. If the cooling system does
not include an integrated radiation shield (or one cannot be easily made), one 
alternative is to wrap several layers of super-insulation (aluminized mylar) loosely
between the vacuum shroud and load. This reduces radiation transfer to the 
sample space.

2.10.10 Resistor Self
Heating Versus
Excitation

Even after leads are properly heat sunk and noise is effectively shielded, there can be a
temperature error in resistance measurements that comes from within. Self-heating
will occur when the power from excitation current is large enough to warm the resistor above the temperature of its surroundings. The effect is most noticeable at low
temperatures because the thermal conduction becomes very poor. The self-heating
error can be determined by either calculating the error using the thermal resistance
of the sensor or by lowering the excitation current until self-heating does not cause
change in measured resistance.
To calculate the self-heating first determine the thermal resistance of the sensor and
package at the desired temperature (contact Lake Shore for typical thermal resistances of common sensors). Second, calculate the self-heating according to the equation ,TSH=I2ReRt, where ,TSH is the error due to self-heating, I is the excitation
current, Re is the electrical resistance, and Rt is the thermal resistance.
To measure the effect of self-heating use the current ranges available in the
Model 350. Begin by cooling the resistor to the desired temperature and measure its
value using the highest current excitation available for the resistor being measured.
Step up one resistance range (dropping the current by about 2/3) and measure resistance again. A change in measured value indicates self-heating was present on the
higher range. Continue increasing the resistance range until the change is no longer
significant to the measurement. If there is still a measured change at the lowest current setting, then a different sensor may need to be chosen. A variety of sensor packages and typical resistances are available, so a sensor with a lower typical resistance
or more thermal resistance at the desired temperature may be required. Thermal
resistance changes with temperature so this process must be repeated at several
temperatures.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

2.11.1 Heater Resistance and Power

35

Not everyone uses the lowest excitation range available. This is due to noise, or more
appropriately signal to noise. Noise from a variety of sources affects the small signals
used to make resistance measurements. Lowering excitation makes the signals even
smaller but unfortunately doesn’t decrease the noise. Even with careful installation
noise effects cannot be eliminated. The goal of most low temperature measurements
is to choose an excitation that is the best compromise between self-heating and signal to noise.

2.11 Heater
Selection and
Installation

There is a variety of resistive heaters that can be used as the controlled heating source
for temperature control. The mostly metal alloys like nichrome are usually wire or foil.
Shapes and sizes vary to permit installation into different systems.

2.11.1 Heater
Resistance and Power

Cryogenic cooling systems have a wide range of cooling power. The resistive heater
must be able to provide sufficient heating power to warm the system.
2.11.1.1 Main Heater Warmup: Output 1
The Model 350 can provide up to 75 W of power from Output 1. Output 1 is designed
to provide large amounts of heat for controlling at higher temperatures, or for warmup. TABLE 2-3 provides the current and voltage limits for Output 1, as well as the
resulting maximum power for Output 1 for the 25 ) and 50 ) settings, using nominal
heater load values.

2.11.1.3 Calculating Power Limits
Even though the Model 350 heater outputs are current sources, they are limited in
voltage by the voltage compliance limit. This compliance voltage also limits maximum power. So for heater values other than 25 ) or 50 ), and for values other than
100 ) on Output 2, calculate the maximum power using the following equations: P =
I2R and P = V2/R, where P is maximum power, I is max current, V is max voltage, and R
is the heater resistance. The current and voltage limits are in place at the same time,
so the smaller of the two computations gives the maximum power available to the
heater

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

Example 1: A 20 ) heater is connected to Output 1, and the heater resistance setting
is set to 25 ), which can provide up to 2 A of current, and up to 50 V.

P = (1.732 A)2 x (20 ))
P = 60 W

Voltage Limit:
P = V2/R
P = (50 V)2/(20 ))
P = 125 W

The power limit is the smaller of the two, or 60 W, limited by current.
Example 2: A 120 ) heater is connected to Output 2, which is designed to provide
maximum power of 1 W at 100 ) by sourcing 100 mA of current.
Current Limit
P = I2R
P = (0.1 A)2 x (120 ))
P = 1.2 W

Voltage Limit:
P = V2/R
P = (10 V)2/(120 ))
P = 0.83 W

The power limit is the smaller of the two, or 0.83 W, limited by voltage.
It is possible to choose a heater value that results in a maximum power greater than the
power rating of 75 W for output 1, but doing so can cause the Model 350 to work improperly. In this situation the max user current setting should be used to limit the power. Refer
to section 4.5.1.1.1 for details on using the max user current setting.

The resistor chosen as a heater must be able to withstand the power being dissipated
in it. Pre-packaged resistors have a power specification that is usually given for the
resistor in free air. This power may need to be derated if used in a vacuum where convection cooling cannot take place and it is not adequately anchored to a cooled surface. The Model 350 has a current limit feature which allows you to specify the
maximum output current for Output 1 (section 4.5.1.1), which when set appropriately will help protect the heater from being over heated.
2.11.1.4 Outputs 3 and 4
Outputs 3 and 4 are analog voltage outputs that can be used for various purposes,
including closed loop PID control, and still heater applications. For more information
on these outputs, refer to section 3.6.

2.11.2 Heater Location

For best temperature measurement accuracy, position the heater so that temperature gradients across the sample is minimized. For best control the heater should be
in close thermal contact with the cooling power. Geometry of the load can make one
or both of these difficult to achieve. That is why there are several heater shapes and
sizes.

2.11.3 Heater Types

Resistive wire like nichrome is the most flexible type of heater available. The wire can
be purchased with electrical insulation and has a predictable resistance per given
length. This type of heater wire can be wrapped around a load to give balanced, even
heating of the area. Similar to sensor lead wire, the entire length of the heater wire
should be in good thermal contact with the load to allow for thermal transfer. Thermal anchoring also protects the wire from over heating and burning out.
Resistive heater wire is also wound into cartridge heaters. Cartridge heaters are more
convenient, but are bulky and more difficult to place on small loads. A typical cartridge is 6.35 mm (0.25 in) in diameter and 25.4 mm (1 in) long. The cartridge should
be snugly held in a hole in the load or clamped to a flat surface. Thermal anchoring for
good thermal contact is again important.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

2.11.4 Heater Wiring

37

Foil heaters are thin layers of resistive material adhered to, or screened onto, electrically insulating sheets. There are a variety of shapes and sizes. The proper size heater
can evenly heat a flat surface or around a round load. The entire active area should be
in good thermal contact with the load, not only for maximum heating effect, but to
keep spots in the heater from over heating and burning out.

2.11.4 Heater Wiring

When wiring inside a vacuum shroud, we recommend using 30 AWG copper wire for
heater leads. Too much heat can transfer in when larger wire is used. Thermal anchoring, similar to that used for the sensor leads, should be included so that any heat
transfer does not warm the load when the heater is not running. The lead wires
should be twisted to minimize noise coupling between the heater and other leads in
the system. When wiring outside the vacuum shroud, you can use larger gage copper,
and twisting is still recommended.

2.12 Consideration
for Good Control

Most of the techniques discussed in section 2.10 and section 2.11 to improve cryogenic temperature accuracy apply to control as well. There is an obvious exception in
sensor location. A compromise is suggested below in section 2.12.3.

2.12.1 Thermal
Conductivity

Good thermal conductivity is important in any part of a cryogenic system that is
intended to be at the same temperature. Most systems begin with materials that
have good conductivity themselves, but as sensors, heaters, sample holders, etc., are
added to an ever more crowded space, the junctions between parts are often overlooked. In order for control to work well, junctions between the elements of the control loop must be in close thermal contact and have good thermal conductivity.
Gasket materials should always be used along with reasonable pressure (section
2.10.4 and section 2.10.5).

2.12.2 Thermal Lag

Poor thermal conductivity causes thermal gradients that reduce accuracy and also
cause thermal lag that make it difficult for controllers to do their job. Thermal lag is
the time it takes for a change in heating or cooling power to propagate through the
load and get to the feedback sensor. Because the feedback sensor is the only thing
that lets the controller know what is happening in the system, slow information to
the sensor slows the response time. For example, if the temperature at the load drops
slightly below the setpoint, the controller gradually increases heating power. If the
feedback information is slow, the controller puts too much heat into the system
before it is told to reduce heat. The excess heat causes a temperature overshoot,
which degrades control stability. The best way to improve thermal lag is to pay close
attention to thermal conductivity both in the parts used and their junctions.

2.12.3 Two-Sensor
Approach

There is a conflict between the best sensor location for measurement accuracy and
the best sensor location for control. For measurement accuracy the sensor should be
very near the sample being measured, which is away from the heating and cooling
sources to reduce heat flow across the sample and thermal gradients. The best control stability is achieved when the feedback sensor is near both the heater and cooling
source to reduce thermal lag. If both control stability and measurement accuracy are
critical it may be necessary to use two sensors, one for each function. Many temperature controllers including the Model 350 have multiple sensor inputs for this reason.

2.12.4 Thermal Mass

Cryogenic designers understandably want to keep the thermal mass of the load as
small as possible so the system can cool quickly and improve cycle time. Small mass
can also have the advantage of reduced thermal gradients. Controlling a very small
mass is difficult because there is no buffer to adsorb small changes in the system.
Without buffering, small disturbances can very quickly create large temperature
changes. In some systems it is necessary to add a small amount of thermal mass such
as a copper block in order to improve control stability.

2.12.5 System 
Non-Linearity

Because of nonlinearities, a system controlling well at one temperature may not control well at another temperature. While nonlinearities exist in all temperature control
systems, they are most evident at cryogenic temperatures. When the operating temperature changes the behavior of the control loop, the controller must be retuned. As
an example, a thermal mass acts differently at different temperatures. The specific
heat of the load material is a major factor in thermal mass. The specific heat of 
materials like copper change as much as three orders of magnitude when cooled from
100 K to 10 K. Changes in cooling power and sensor sensitivity are also sources 
of nonlinearity.
The cooling power of most cooling sources also changes with load temperature. This
is very important when operating at temperatures near the highest or lowest temperature that a system can reach. Nonlinearities within a few degrees of these high
and low temperatures make it very difficult to configure them for stable control. If difficulty is encountered, it is recommended to gain experience with the system at temperatures several degrees away from the limit and gradually approach it in small
steps.
Keep an eye on temperature sensitivity. Sensitivity not only affects control stability,
but it also contributes to the overall control system gain. The large changes in sensitivity that make some sensors so useful may make it necessary to retune the control
loop more often.

2.13 PID Control

For closed-loop operation, the Model 350 temperature controller uses an algorithm
called PID control. The control equation for the PID algorithm has three variable
terms: proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D). See FIGURE 2-4. Changing
these variables for best control of a system is called tuning. The PID equation in the 
Model 350 is:
Heater Output = P e + I  e  dt + D de
------



dt

where the error (e) is defined as: e = Setpoint – Feedback Reading.
Proportional is discussed in section 2.13.1. Integral is discussed in section 2.13.2.
Derivative is discussed in section 2.13.3. Finally, the manual heater output is discussed in section 2.13.4.

2.13.1 Proportional (P)

The Proportional term, also called gain, must have a value greater than 0 for the control loop to operate. The value of the proportional term is multiplied by the error (e)
which is defined as the difference between the setpoint and feedback temperatures,
to generate the proportional contribution to the output: Output (P) = Pe. If proportional is acting alone, with no integral, there must always be an error or the output
will go to 0. A great deal must be known about the load, sensor, and controller to compute a proportional setting (P). Most often, the proportional setting is determined by
trial and error. The proportional setting is part of the overall control loop gain, and so
are the heater range and cooling power. The proportional setting will need to change
if either of these change.

2.13.2 Integral (I)

In the control loop, the integral term, also called reset, looks at error over time to build
the integral contribution to the output:



Output (I) = PI  e  dt

Model 350 Temperature Controller

2.13.3 Derivative (D)

39

By adding the integral to proportional contributions, the error that is necessary in a
proportional only system can be eliminated. When the error is at 0, controlling at the
setpoint, the output is held constant by the integral contribution. The integral setting
(I) is more predictable than the gain setting. It is related to the dominant time constant of the load. As discussed in section 2.14.3, measuring this time constant allows
a reasonable calculation of the integral setting. In the Model 350, the integral term is
not set in seconds like some other systems. The integral setting can be derived by
dividing 1000 by the integral seconds: Isetting = 1000 / Iseconds.

2.13.3 Derivative (D)

The derivative term, also called rate, acts on the change in error with time to make its
contribution to the output:

de
dt

Output (D) = PD ------

By reacting to a fast changing error signal the derivative can work to boost the output
when the setpoint changes quickly, reducing the time it takes for temperature to
reach the setpoint. It can also see the error decreasing rapidly when the temperature
nears the setpoint and reduce the output for less overshoot. The derivative term can
be useful in fast changing systems, but it is often turned off during steady state control because it reacts too strongly to small disturbances. The derivative setting (D) is
related to the dominant time constant of the load similar to the I-setting and is therefore set relative to I-setting when used.

2.13.4 Manual Output

The Model 350 has a control setting that is not a normal part of a PID control loop.
Manual Output can be used for open loop control, meaning feedback is ignored and
the heater output stays at the user's manual setting. This is a good way to put constant heating power into a load when needed. The Manual Output term can also be
added to the PID output. Some users prefer to set a power near that necessary to control at a setpoint and let the closed loop make up the small difference. Manual Output
is set in percent of full scale current or power for a given heater range
(section 4.5.1.5.5).
Manual Output should be set to 0% when not in use.

2.14 Manual
Tuning

There has been a lot written about tuning closed loop control systems and specifically
PID control loops. This section does not attempt to compete with control theory
experts. It describes a few basic rules of thumb to help less experienced users get
started. This technique will not solve every problem, but it has worked for many others in the field. This section assumes you have worked through the operation sections
of this manual, have a good temperature reading from the sensor chosen as a control
sensor, and are operating Loop 1. It is also a good idea to begin at the center of the
temperature range of the cooling system (not close to its highest or lowest temperature). Autotune (section 2.15) is another good place to begin, and do not forget the
power of trial and error.

2.14.1 Setting Heater
Range

Setting an appropriate heater output range is an important first part of the tuning
process. The heater range should allow enough heater power to comfortably overcome the cooling power of the cooling system. If the heater range will not provide
enough power, the load will not be able to reach the setpoint temperature. Conversely, if the range is set too high, the load may have very large temperature changes
that take a long time to settle out. Delicate loads can even be damaged by too 
much power.
Often there is little information on the cooling power of the cooling system at the
desired setpoint. If this is the case, try the following: allow the load to cool completely
with the heater off. Set Manual Output to 50% while in Open Loop control mode. Turn
the heater to the lowest range and write down the temperature rise (if any). Select
the next highest heater range and continue the process until the load warms up to
room temperature. Do not leave the system unattended; the heater may have to be
turned off manually to prevent overheating. If the load never reaches room temperature, some adjustment may be needed in heater resistance or load.
The list of heater range versus load temperature is a good reference for selecting the
proper heater range. It is common for systems to require two or more heater ranges
for good control over their full temperature. Lower heater ranges are normally
needed for lower temperature. The Model 350 is of no use controlling at or below the
temperature reached when the heater was off. Many systems can be tuned to control
within a degree or two above that temperature.

2.14.2 Tuning
Proportional

The proportional setting is so closely tied to heater range that they can be thought of
as fine and course adjustments of the same setting. An appropriate heater range must
be known before moving on to the proportional setting.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Allow the cooling system to cool and stabilize with the heater off.
Place the Model 350 in closed loop PID mode tuning,
Turn integral, derivative and manual output settings to 0.
Enter a setpoint several degrees above the cooling system’s lowest temperature.
Enter a low proportional setting of approximately 5 or 10, and enter the appropriate heater range as described in section 2.14.1.
6. The load temperature should stabilize at a temperature below the setpoint. The
heater display should show a value greater than 0% and less than 100%. If the
load temperature does not stabilize below the setpoint, do one of the following:
a.

If the load temperature and heater display reading swing rapidly, the
proportional setting or possibly the heater range may be set too high.
Reduce the proportional setting or the heater range, and go back 
to step 6.
b. If the load temperature and heater display reading change very slowly, a
condition described as drift, it is an indication of a proportional setting
that is too low. Increase the proportional setting and go back to step 6.

42

cHAPTER 2: Cooling System Design and Temperature Control

7. Gradually increase the proportional setting by doubling it each time. At each new
setting, allow time for the temperature of the load to stabilize.
8. Repeat step 7 until you reach a setting in which the load temperature begins a
sustained and predictable oscillation, rising and falling in a consistent period of
time. See FIGURE 2-4(a).
The goal is to find the proportional value in which the oscillation begins, do not turn the
setting so high that temperature and heater output changes become extreme.

9. If step 8 is achieved, complete steps 10 and 11, if not skip to step 12.
10. Record the proportional setting and the amount of time it takes for the load to
change from one temperature peak to the next. The time is called the oscillation
period of the load. It helps describe the dominant time constant of the load,
which is used in setting integral.
11. Reduce the proportional setting by half. The appropriate proportional setting is
one half of the value required for sustained oscillation in step 8. See 
FIGURE 2-4(b). Continue to Tuning Integral section 2.14.3.
12. There are a few systems that will stabilize and not oscillate with a very high proportional setting and a proper heater range setting. For these systems, setting a
proportional setting of one half of the highest setting is a good starting point.
Continue to the Tuning Integral section 2.14.3.

2.14.3 Tuning Integral

When the proportional setting is chosen and the integral is set to 0 (off), the
Model 350 controls the load temperature below the setpoint. Setting the integral
allows the Model 350 control algorithm to gradually eliminate the difference in temperature by integrating the error over time. See FIGURE 2-4(d). An integral setting
that is too low causes the load to take too long to reach the setpoint. An integral 
setting that is too high creates instability and can cause the load temperature 
to oscillate.
1. Begin this part of the tuning process with the system controlling in proportional
only mode.
2. Use the oscillation period of the load that was measured in section 2.14.2 in seconds. Divide 1000 by the oscillation period to get the integral setting.
3. Enter the integral setting into the Model 350 and watch the load temperature
approach the setpoint.
4. Adjust the integral setting if necessary:
a.

If the temperature does not stabilize and begins to oscillate around the
setpoint, the integral setting is too high and should be reduced by 
one half.
b. If the temperature is stable but never reaches the setpoint, the integral
setting is too low and should be doubled.
5. Verify the integral setting by making a few small (2 K to 5 K) changes in setpoint,
and watch the load temperature react.
Trial and error can help improve the integral setting by optimizing for experimental
needs. Faster integrals, for example, get to the setpoint more quickly at the expense
of greater overshoot. In most systems, setpoint changes that raise the temperature
act differently than changes that lower the temperature.
If it was not possible to measure the oscillation period of the load during proportional
setting, start with an integral setting of 20. If the load becomes unstable, reduce the
setting by half. If the load is stable, make a series of small, two to five degree changes
in the setpoint and watch the load react. Continue to increase the integral setting
until the desired response is achieved.

2.14.4 Tuning Derivative

2.14.4 Tuning
Derivative

43

If an experiment requires frequent changes in setpoint, derivative should be considered. See FIGURE 2-4(e). A derivative setting of 0, off, is recommended when the control system is seldom changed and data is taken when the load is at steady state.
The derivative setting is entered into the Model 350 as a percentage of the integral
time constant. The setting range is 0–200% where 100% = ¼ I seconds. Start with a
setting of 50% to 100%.
Again, do not be afraid to make some small setpoint changes; halving or doubling this
setting to watch the affect. Expect positive setpoint changes to react differently from
negative setpoint changes.

2.15 Autotuning

Choosing appropriate PID control settings can be tedious. Systems can take several
minutes to complete a setpoint change, making it difficult to watch the display for
oscillation periods and signs of instability. With the Autotune feature, the Model 350
automates the tuning process by measuring system characteristics and, along with
some assumptions about typical cryogenic systems, computes setting values for P, I,
and D. Autotune works only with one control loop at a time and does not set the manual output or heater range. Setting an inappropriate heater range is potentially dangerous to some loads, so the Model 350 does not automate that step of the tuning
process.
When Autotune is initiated, step changes are applied to the setpoint and the system
response is observed to determine the best tuning parameters.
The Autotuning message appears when autotuning, and the display is configured to
show the output of the control loop being tuned. The message blinks to indicate that
the algorithm is still processing, and displays the current stage of the process, such as
Stage 3 of 7. If the tuning process completes successfully, then the message is
removed and the new PID parameters are configured. If the algorithm fails, the message stops blinking to indicate that it is no longer processing, and a failure message
appears to indicate which stage of the process failed.
There are situations where Autotune is not the answer. The algorithm can be fooled
when cooling systems are very fast, very slow, have a large thermal lag, or have a nonlinear relationship between heater power and load temperature. If a load can reach a
new setpoint in under 10 sec (with an appropriate I-setting >500), the cooling system
is too fast for Autotuning. Systems with a very small thermal mass can be this fast.
Adding mass is a solution, but is unappealing to users who need the speed for fast
cycle times. Manual tuning is not difficult on these systems because new settings can
be tested very quickly. Some systems are too slow for the Autotune algorithm. Any
system that takes more than 15 min to stabilize at a new setpoint is too slow (with an
appropriate I-setting <5).
Thermal lag can be improved by using the sensor and heater installation techniques
discussed in section 2.10 to section 2.12. Lag times up to a few seconds should be
expected; much larger lags can be a problem. System nonlinearity is a problem for
both autotune and manual tuning. It is most commonly noticed when controlling
near the maximum or minimum temperature of a temperature control system. It is
not uncommon; however, for a user to buy a cryogenic cooling system specifically to
operate near its minimum temperature. If this is the case, try to tune the system at 5
degrees above the minimum temperature and gradually reduce the setpoint, manually adjusting the control settings with each step. Any time the mechanical cooling
action of a cryogenic refrigerator can be seen as periodic temperature fluctuations,
the mass is too small or temperature too low to autotune.

2.16 Zone Tuning

Once the PID tuning parameters have been chosen for a given setpoint, the whole
process may have to be done again for other setpoints significantly far away that
have different tuning needs. Trying to remember when to use which set of tuning
parameters can be difficult. The Model 350 has a Zone feature as one of its tuning
modes that can help.
To use the Zone feature, you must determine the best tuning parameters for each part
of the temperature range of interest. Then enter the parameters into the Model 350
where up to 10 zones can be defined with different P, I, D, heater range, manual output, ramp rate, and control input settings. An upper boundary setting is assigned as
the maximum temperature for that zone. The minimum temperature for a zone is the
upper boundary for the previous zone, and 0 K is the starting point for the first zone.
When Zone tuning is on, each time the setpoint changes, appropriate control parameters are chosen automatically. Zone tuning works best when used in conjunction
with setpoint ramping (section 4.5.1.5.7).
You can determine control parameters manually or you can use the Autotune feature.
Autotune is a good way to determine a set of tuning parameters for the control system that can then be entered as zones (section 2.15).

2.17 
Thermoelectric
Devices

A thermoelectric device, sometimes referred to as a Peltier device, or a solid state heat
pump, is a device that takes advantage of the Peltier effect. When a DC current is
applied to the device, heat is transferred from one side of the device to the other. Heat
can be transferred in either direction by reversing the polarity of the current. Thermoelectric devices are well suited for controlling temperatures near room temperature
since they have both heating and cooling capabilities. Since thermoelectric devices
are solid state, they are free of the mechanical vibrations associated with mechanical
coolers. Some thermoelectric coolers, in a stacked configuration, are capable of cooling devices down to cryogenic temperatures (about 100 K). These are often used to
cool and maintain the temperatures of charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors.
Since thermoelectric devices are capable of both heating and cooling, they require a
controller that has a bipolar output to take full advantage of this. The Model 350 can
be configured for bipolar control on Outputs 3 and 4. Closed loop PID control works
the same in bipolar mode as it does in unipolar mode except that the output can go
negative instead of stopping at zero. Refer to section 5.4 to setup Output 3 and 4 in
bipolar mode.
The Model 350 cannot drive a thermoelectric device directly. Most thermoelectric
devices require high current (approximately 3 A) and low voltage (typically < 10 V).
Output 3 and 4 are capable of ±10 V and ±100 mA. An external power amplifier is necessary to boost the power up to a level that will effectively control the thermoelectric
device. Refer to section 3.6.5 for more information on using an external power amplifier with Outputs 3 and 4.

The line fuse is an important safety feature of the Model 350. If a fuse ever fails, it is
important to replace it with the value and type indicated on the rear panel for the line
voltage setting. The letter T on the fuse rating indicates that the instrument requires
a time-delay or slow-blow fuse. Fuse values should be verified any time line voltage
configuration is changed. Refer to section 8.6 for instructions for changing and verifying a line fuse.

3.4.3 Power Cord

3.4.3 Power Cord

47

The Model 350 includes a 3-conductor power cord that mates with the IEC 320-C14
line cord receptacle. Line voltage is present on the two outside conductors and the
center conductor is a safety ground. The safety ground attaches to the instrument
chassis and protects the user in case of a component failure. A CE approved power
cord is included with instruments shipped to Europe; a domestic power cord is
included with all other instruments (unless otherwise specified when ordered).
Always plug the power cord into a properly grounded receptacle to ensure safe instrument operation. Do not use a detachable mains supply cord with inadequate rating.

Position the Model 350 in such a way to enable easy access to the disconnecting device.
Failure to comply could result in death or injury to personnel.
If the power supply cord is damaged or lost, it must be replaced. Contact Lake Shore for a
replacement to ensure proper voltage, current and type of cord. The power supply cord
must not exceed 3 m in length.

The delicate nature of measurements being taken with this instrument may necessitate additional grounding including ground strapping of the instrument chassis. In
these cases the operators safety should remain the highest priority and low impedance from the instrument chassis to safety ground should always be maintained.

3.4.4 Power Switch

The power switch is part of the line input assembly on the rear panel of the Model 350
and turns line power to the instrument on and off. When the circle is depressed,
power is off. When the line is depressed, power is on.

3.5 Diode/Resistor
Sensor Inputs

This section details how to connect diode and resistive sensors to the Model 350

Connector and Pinout

The input connectors are 6-pin DIN 45322 sockets. The sensor connector pins are
defined in FIGURE 3-3 and TABLE 3-2. Four mating connectors (6-pin DIN plugs) are
included in the connector kit shipped with the instrument. These are common connectors, so additional mating connectors can be purchased from local electronics
suppliers. They can also be ordered from Lake Shore as G-106-233.

3.5.2 Sensor Lead Cable

The sensor lead cable used outside the cooling system can be much different from
what is used inside. Between the instrument and vacuum shroud, heat leak is not a
concern. In this case, choose cabling to minimize error and noise pick up. Larger conductor, 22 AWG to 28 AWG stranded copper wire is recommended because it has low
resistance yet remains flexible when several wires are bundled in a cable. The
arrangement of wires in a cable is also important. For best results, voltage leads, V+
and V- should be twisted together and current leads I+ and I- should be twisted
together. The twisted pairs of voltage and current leads should then be covered with a
braided or foil shield that is connected to the shield pin of the instrument. This type of
cable is available through local electronics suppliers. Instrument specifications are
given assuming 3 m (10 ft) of sensor cable. Longer cables, 30 m (100 ft) or more, can
be used, but environmental conditions may degrade accuracy and noise specifications. Refer to section 2.10.6 for information about wiring inside the cryostat.

3.5.3 Grounding and
Shielding Sensor Leads

The sensor inputs are isolated from earth ground to reduce the amount of earth
ground referenced noise that is present on the measurement leads. Connecting sensor leads to earth ground on the chassis of the instrument or in the cooling system
will defeat that isolation. Grounding leads on more than one sensor prevents the sensor excitation current sources from operating.
Shielding the sensor lead cable is important to keep external noise from entering the
measurement. A shield is most effective when it is near the measurement potential so
the Model 350 offers a shield at measurement common. The shield of the sensor
cable should be connected to the shield pin of the input connector. The shields should
not be connected to earth ground on the instrument chassis. One shield should be
connected to the cryostat’s ground as long as it is near earth ground. Connecting at
more than one point will cause a ground loop, which adds noise to the measurement.
The shells of the input connectors are at the same potential as the shield pin on the
Model 350. Older Lake Shore controllers are not configured this way.

3.5.4 Four-Lead Sensor
Measurement

All sensors, including both two-lead and four-lead can be measured with a four-lead
technique. The purpose of a four-lead measurement is to eliminate the effect of lead
resistance on the measurement. If it is not taken out, lead resistance is a direct error
when measuring a sensor.
In a four-lead measurement, current leads and voltage leads are run separately up to
the sensor. With separate leads there is little current in the voltage leads, so their
resistance does not enter into the measurement. Resistance in the current leads will
not change the measurement as long as the voltage compliance of the current source
is not reached. When two-lead sensors are used in four-lead measurements, the short
leads on the sensor have an insignificant resistance.

3.5.5 Two-Lead Sensor
Measurement

There are times when crowding in a cryogenic system forces users to read sensors in a
two-lead configuration because there are not enough feedthroughs or room for lead
wires. If this is the case, plus voltage to plus current and minus voltage to minus current leads are attached at the back of the instrument or at the vacuum feedthrough.
The error in a resistive measurement is the resistance of the lead wire run with current and voltage together. If the leads contribute 2 ) or 3 ) to a 10 k) reading, the
error can probably be tolerated.
Connectors are also a big source of error when making two-lead measurements. Connector contact resistance is unpredictable and changes with time and temperature.
Minimize interconnections when making two-lead measurements. Refer to FIGURE

This section describes the diode/resistor sensor inputs.
Lake Shore sensors are shipped with instructions that indicate which sensor leads are
which. It is important to follow these instructions for plus and minus leads (polarity)
as well as voltage and current when applicable. Two-lead resistors can operate with
any lead arrangement and the sensor instructions may not specify. Four-lead resistors can be more dependent on lead arrangement. Follow any specified lead assignment for four-lead resistors. Mixing leads could give a reading that appears correct
but is not the most accurate.

3.5.8 Capacitance
Sensor Inputs
(Model 3061)

This section provides information for a Model 350 configured with the capacitance
sensor input option card. Capacitance inputs are not installed on the standard Model
350, but it can be added by purchasing the Model 3061 capacitance input option.
Refer to section 7.4 for installation of the Model 3061.
The Model 3061 adds a capacitance input to the Model 350, appearing on the display
as input D. The card has separate voltage feedback and current excitation for the sensor. The Model 3061 is intended to control temperature in strong magnetic fields
using a Lake Shore Model CS-501 capacitance temperature sensor. The standard
inputs remain in the instrument and are fully functional.
Upon changing control to the capacitive sensor, the PID values will need to be optimized.

The Model 350 does not support temperature conversion for the capacitance input.
The temperature response of capacitance sensors shifts with thermal cycling, making
calibration unpredictable. All Model 3061 option measurement and control must be
done in sensor units. With this option, two sensors should be installed at the control
point. Use a resistive sensor in one of the standard inputs to establish a control temperature and stabilize the system in a low magnetic field. Before increasing the field
strength, shift control to the capacitance sensor to maintain the current 
temperature.

3.5.8.1 Wiring, Guarding and Shielding
The capacitance input uses the same 6-pin din connector as the standard inputs, and
the same pins for current excitation and voltage feedback. Cable capacitance in longer cables can cause large sensor reading errors if proper guarding and shielding
methods are not applied. To address this problem, a driven guard is provided on pin 6,
and a shield pin is provided on pin 3. The guard pin should be connected to a foil shield
that surrounds a single twisted pair of wires used for I+ and V+. The shield pin on pin 3
should be connected to a foil shield that surrounds a single twisted pair of wires used
for I- and V-. See FIGURE 3-7. This wiring scheme must be applied to ensure proper
sensor readings using the Model 3061 capacitance option

The 3.496 kHz excitation of the option card can interfere with the sensitive DC measurements of the standard inputs. Tightly twist the lead wires of each sensor and separate
them from the leads from the other sensor. Test any system for sensor interference before
it is permanently sealed.

3.5.9 Thermocouple
Sensor Inputs
(Thermocouple Model
3060)

The information in this section is for a Model 350 configured with thermocouple sensor inputs. Thermocouple inputs are not installed on the standard Model 350, but can
be added by purchasing the Model 3060 dual thermocouple input option.

Do not leave thermocouple inputs unconnected. Short inputs when not in use.

3.5.9.1 Sensor Input Terminals
Attach sensor leads to the screws on the off-white ceramic terminal blocks. Sensor
connection is important when using thermocouples because the measured signal is
small. Many measurement errors can be avoided with proper sensor installation. The
block has two thermocouple inputs and each input has two screw terminals; one positive, one negative. See FIGURE 3-8.

52

cHAPTER 3: Installation

Remove all insulation, then tighten the screws on the thermocouple wires. Keep the
ceramic terminal blocks away from heat sources including sunlight and shield them
from fans or room drafts.

FIGURE 3-8 Thermocouple input definition and
common connector polarities (inputs shown shorted)

3.5.9.2 Thermocouple Installation
Thermocouples are commonly used in high-temperature applications. Cryogenic use
of thermocouples offers some unique challenges. A general installation guideline is
provided in section 2.10. Consider the following when using thermocouples at low
temperatures:

D Thermocouple wire is generally more thermally conductive than other sensor

D

lead wire. Smaller gauge wire and more thermal anchoring may be needed to
prevent leads from heating the sample.
Attaching lead wires and passing them through vacuum tight connectors is often
necessary in cryogenic systems. Remember, the thermocouple wire is the sensor;
any time it joins or contacts other metal, there is potential for error.
Temperature verification and calibration of room temperature compensation is
difficult after the sensor is installed. When possible, keep a piece of scrap wire
from each installation for future use.
Thermocouples can be spot-welded to the cryostat for good thermal anchoring as
long as the cryostat has a potential close to earth ground.

3.5.9.3 Grounding and Shielding
Care must be taken to minimize the amount of noise contributed by ground loops,
when grounding thermocouple inputs. For lowest measurement noise, do not ground
thermocouple sensors. The instrument operates with slightly more noise if one of the
thermocouples is grounded. Be sure to minimize loop area when grounding both
thermocouples. The instrument does not offer a shield connection on the terminal
block. Twisting the thermocouple wires helps reject noise. If shielding is necessary,
extend the shield from the oven or cryostat to cover the thermocouple wire, but do
not attach the shield to the instrument.

3.6 Heater Output
Setup

The following section covers the heater wiring from the vacuum shroud to the instrument for both heater outputs. Specifications are detailed in section 1.6. For help on
choosing and installing an appropriate resistive heater, refer to section 2.11.

3.6.1 Heater Output
Description

This section describes Output 1 and Output 2.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

3.6.2 Heater Output Connectors

53

3.6.1.1 Output 1
Output 1 is a traditional control output for a cryogenic temperature controller. It is a
DC current source with software settable ranges and limits. It is designed for high
power (up to 75 W), providing control at higher temperatures, and fast warmup capability. Output 1 is configurable for optimization using either a 25 ) or a 50 ) heater
resistance. At the 50 ) setting, it is limited to a maximum output current of 1 A, and at
the 25 ) setting, the maximum heater output current is 1.73 A . The compliance voltage is 50 V minimum, but can reach as high as 58 V if the heater resistance is higher
than the nominal setting. Heater power is applied in one of five ranges. Each range is
one decade lower in power. Refer to TABLE 3-3 for maximum current and power ratings into different heater resistances.
3.6.1.2 Output 2
Output 2 is also a DC current source, but is designed for low power (up to 1 W), providing stable control at very low temperatures. It is limited to a maximum output current
of 100 mA, and a compliance voltage of at least 10 V, but can be as high as approximately 13 V. Output 2 also has five ranges, each one decade lower in power than the
last. Refer to TABLE 3-3 for maximum current and power ratings into different heater
resistances.

3.6.2 Heater Output
Connectors

Dual banana jacks on the rear panel of the instrument are used for connecting wires
to the heater outputs. Two standard dual banana plug mating connectors are
included in the connector kit shipped with the instrument. This is a common jack, and
additional mating connectors can be purchased from local electronic suppliers, or
from Lake Shore as P/N 106-009. The heater is connected between the HI 
and LO terminals.

FIGURE 3-9 Rear panel showing heater output connectors

54

cHAPTER 3: Installation

3.6.3 Heater Output
Wiring

Heater output current is what determines the size (gauge) of wire needed to connect
the heater. The maximum current that can be sourced from heater Output 1 is
1.732 A. When less current is needed to power a cooling system, it can be limited with
range settings.
When setting up a temperature control system, the lead wire for the heater must be
capable of carrying a continuous current that is greater than the maximum current.
Wire manufacturers recommend 26 AWG or larger wire to carry 1.732 A of current,
but there is little advantage in using wire smaller than 20 AWG to 22 AWG outside the
cryostat. Inside the cryostat, smaller gauge wire is often desirable.
It is recommended to use twisted heater leads. Large changes in heater current can
induce noise in measurement leads and twisting reduces the effect. It is also recommended to run heater leads in a separate cable from the measurement leads to further reduce interaction.
There is a chassis ground point at the rear panel of the instrument for shielding the
heater cable if necessary. The cable shield can be tied to this point using a 3.18 mm
(#4) spade terminal, or ring connector. The shield should not be connected at the
opposite end of the cable and should never be tied to the heater output leads.
For best noise performance, do not connect the resistive heater or its leads to ground.
Also avoid connecting heater leads to sensor leads or any other instrument inputs or
outputs.

3.6.4 Heater Output
Noise

The heater output circuitry in the Model 350 is capable of sourcing 75 W of power.
This type of circuitry can generate some electrical noise. The Model 350 was designed
to generate as little noise as possible, but even noise that is a small percentage of the
output voltage or current can be too much when sensitive measurements are being
made near by. Heater output noise can be most detrimental when controlling at very
low temperatures. Heater Output 2 uses a fully linear power supply to minimize
heater noise. The switching power supply used for Output 1 is turned completely off
when Output 1 is off. For best results use Output 2 for control, and ensure Output 1 is
off when controlling at very low temperatures. If the Model 350 heater leads are too
noisy and the above wiring techniques do not help, Lake Shore offers the Model 3003
Heater Output Conditioner that may help.

3.6.5 Powering Outputs
3 and 4 Using an
External Power Supply

Outputs 3 and 4 cannot power heaters directly when used in warm up control mode.
These unpowered outputs must be used to program an external power supply which
in turn powers the heater. This section describes choosing and installing an external
supply. Section 5.5 describes operation of warm up control mode.
3.6.5.1 Choosing a Power Supply

D Voltage Programmable: the power supply must be voltage programmable so that
Outputs 3 or 4 (control output) can control it. Ideally the supply’s programming
input should have a range of 0 to 10 V that corresponds to 0 to 10 V range of the
control output. This guarantees that 0 to 100% of the control output scales to 
0 to 100% power out of the supply. Supplies with different programming input
ranges can be used as described in section 3.6.5.4.
Be aware that if the input voltage is not within the range of the power supply, damage
may result.

D DC Output Capable: the power supply must be capable of continuous DC output.
Most commercial audio amplifiers are not suitable because they are AC coupled
and cannot provide a DC output.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

3.6.5 Powering Outputs 3 and 4 Using an External Power Supply

D Output Type: most available voltage programmable power supplies are configured

D

D

for voltage output. This is different than Outputs 1 and 2 on the 350 which are
configured for current output. The differences between the two are not significant when used in warm up mode.
Output Voltage: Lake Shore recommends supplies with a working output voltage
between 10 V and 50 V. Voltage higher than 50 V poses a shock hazard and should
only be used if operator safety can be assured by the installer. Voltage lower than
10 V becomes impractical because the current necessary provide any meaningful
power is too high for most cryogenic wiring.
Output Power: there is no limit to the maximum power of the supply. Typical warm
up applications normally range between 25 W and 200 W.

3.6.5.2 Power Supply Setup
Follow all operation and safety instruction in the power supply manual during setup.
Consider the following suggestions for protecting the power supply and heater load.

D Short circuits are common in cryogenic lead wiring. If the power supply does not

D

D

D

specify that it is short circuit protected the power output should be wired with a
fuse in series to prevent damage.
Unipolar power supplies are designed to use a positive programming voltage and
some can be damaged if the programming voltage is negative. Be careful when
wiring the system to maintain the correct polarity. Also, never set the control
output of the Model350 to bipolar mode.
Some power supplies can be damaged if there is a programming voltage present
at their input when they are turned off. This can happen if the Model 350 and
power supply use a different source of line power or are turned on and off individually. It can be avoided if the two instruments share a switched power strip.
The heater and wiring in the system must be rated for both the maximum current
and maximum voltage provided by the power supply. The Model 350 can be set
to warm up using less than full power if the load will not tolerate the full power of 
the supply.

3.6.5.3 Connecting to the Model 350
The voltage programming cable attaches to the removable terminal block on the rear
panel of the Model 350 (FIGURE 3-10). Output number and polarity of the output
leads are indicated on the silk screen. The negative (–) terminals are connected internally to the instrument chassis to provide a ground reference.

FIGURE 3-10 Output terminal block

In the most basic configuration, a two-conductor cable connects directly from the
output terminals to the power supply programming input. Copper wire size 
20 AWG to 26 AWG is recommended.

cHAPTER 3: Installation

3.6.5.4 Programming Voltages Under 10 V
A voltage divider FIGURE 3-11 can be used to reduce the control output voltage if the
programming input of the power supply has a range of less than 0 V to 10 V to ensure
full output resolution, and protection against overloading the external supply programming inputs. The output voltage is proportional to the ratio of resistors 
R1 to R2: Vout = 10V x R1/(R1+R2). It is also important to keep the sum of R1 + R2 >
1000 ) or the Model 350 output may not reach the output voltage setting due to
internal overload protection. For a programming input range of 0 V to 5 V, recommended values are: R1 = R2 = 2000 ). For a programming input range of 0 V to 1 V,
recommended values are: R1 = 500 ), R2 = 4500 ). Exact resistor value, type and tolerance are generally not important for this application.

The bottom half of the display contains information related to the control loop that is
using the sensor input (provided in the top half of the display) as its Control Input
parameter. Only the items applicable to the control loop will be displayed. Specifically, the number of the control loop output, followed by the Output Mode setting is
displayed. The P, I, D, Manual Output, Setpoint, and Heater Output information of the

The input display modes are unique in that they can be set temporarily by pressing
the A, B, C, or D front panel keys. After the key is pressed, the respective input display
mode becomes active for approximately 10 s before returning to the configured display mode. This provides quick access to each input and each associated control loop
for gathering information, or changing control loop parameters. Press any active keys
while the temporary display mode is active to reset the timeout period of the temporary display. Press Escape, or the same temporary display key again, to manually
return the display to the configured display mode. Press and hold a temporary display
key until an audible beep is heard (about 3 s) to cause the configured display mode to
change to the input display mode associated with that key.

Temperature
Coefficient (NTC)
Resistor Sensor Input
Setup

NTC resistor sensors include Cernox™, Rox, Thermox and others detailed in TABLE 4-7.
More detailed specifications are provided in TABLE 1-2. When configured for NTC RTD,
the Sensor Excitation setting becomes available in the Input Setup menu. This setting
allows a choice of 1 mV or 10 mV sensor excitation voltage. This setting determines
the sensor voltage at the full scale of any given resistance range. The 1 mV voltage
level is designed to minimize self-heating effects at the sensor when used at very low
temperatures (below approximately 300 mK). The 1 mV voltage level, however,
results in approximately 10 times more noise in the sensor reading than the
corresponding resistance range at the 10 mV level, reducing measurement
resolution. Therefore it is recommended that the 10 mV level be used for applications
that do not require temperature measurement below about 300 mK.
The excitation current for the NTC RTD sensor type can vary between 10 nA and 1 mA,
depending on resistance range and sensor excitation level chosen. When autoranging
is enabled, the range will be automatically selected so that the excitation voltage is at
or below the sensor excitation setting. This keeps the power dissipated in the sensor
at a minimum, while still providing enough signal to provide accurate measurements.
In very low temperature applications, it is recommended to turn autorange off and
use a higher resistance range (lower current) to minimize the power dissipated in the
sensor, and therefore reduce self-heating effects.
For example, for a Cernox resistor that reads 10 k) at 150 mK, the autorange
algorithm would select the 10 k) range, but manually selecting the 100 k) range
provides 10 times less current, and therefore, 100 times less power into the sensor,
which may be required to significantly reduce the effects of self-heating. Current
Reversal is also enabled by default in order to compensate for thermal EMF voltages.
Refer to section 4.4.4 for details on the Thermal EMF Compensation (Current
Reversal) feature. Refer to section 2.7 for details on self-heating effects.

4.4.4 Thermal
Electromotive Force
(EMF) Compensation

To keep power low and avoid sensor self heating, the sensor excitation is kept low.
There are two major problems that occur when measuring the resulting small DC
voltages. The first is external noise entering the measurement through the sensor
leads, which is discussed with sensor setup. The second is the presence of thermal
EMF voltages, or thermocouple voltages, in the lead wiring. Thermal EMF voltages
appear when there is a temperature gradient across a piece of voltage lead. Thermal
EMF voltages must exist because the sensor is almost never the same temperature as
the instrument. To minimize them, use careful wiring, make sure the voltage leads are
symmetrical in the type of metal used and how they are joined, and keep unnecessary
heat sources away from the leads. Even in a well-designed system thermal EMF voltages can be an appreciable part of a low voltage sensor measurement.
The Model 350 can help with a thermal compensation algorithm. The instrument will
automatically reverse the polarity of the current source every other reading. The
average of the positive and negative sensor readings will cancel the thermal EMF
voltage that is present in the same polarity, regardless of current direction. This correction algorithm is enabled by default for RTD sensor types, but can be turned off
using the Current Reversal parameter.

4.4.5 Thermocouple
Sensor Input Setup
(Model 3060 Only)

When a Model 3060 Thermocouple option is installed in the Model 350, a setting of
Thermocouple becomes available under the Sensor Type parameter in the Input
Setup menu. The standard RTD sensor inputs can still be used when the Thermocouple option is installed, but the Thermocouple and standard inputs cannot be used
simultaneously. Refer to section 7.4.2 to install the Model 30603060.
Thermocouples include a variety of commercial (such as E, K, T) and specialty types
such as cryogenic (Chromel–AuFe). Standard curves are included in the Model 350 for
the types listed in TABLE 4-7. Other types can be used as long as an appropriate temperature response curve is loaded as a user curve. Representative thermocouple specifications are given in TABLE 1-3. The Model 350 provides one thermocouple range
and no excitation because thermocouples do not require it. Internal room temperature compensation is included for convenience (section 4.4.5.2) and should be calibrated before use. Room temperature compensation is enabled by default, but can be
turned off if external compensation is being used.

4.4.5.1 Internal Room Temperature Compensation
Room-temperature compensation is required to give accurate temperature measurements with thermocouple sensors. It corrects for the temperature difference
between the instrument thermal block and the curve normalization temperature of
0 °C. An external ice bath is the most accurate form of compensation, but is often
inconvenient. The Model 350 has internal room-temperature compensation that is
adequate for most applications. You can turn internal compensation on or off. It operates with any thermocouple type that has an appropriate temperature response
curve loaded. Room-temperature compensation is not meaningful for sensor units
measurements.
Room temperature compensation should be calibrated as part of every installation 

Interface Command: INTYPE
4.4.5.2 Internal Room Temperature Compensation Calibration Procedure
Factory calibration of the instrument is accurate to within approximately ±1 K. Differences in thermocouple wire and installation technique create errors greater than the
instrument errors. To achieve the best accuracy, calibrate with the thermocouple
actually being used, because it eliminates most sources of error. If that is not possible,
use a thermocouple made from the same wire.
It is best practice to use the same material for thermocouple wires; if it is at all possible, it
is also best to avoid splices. When splices are necessary, continue the splice with the same
type of material.

For less demanding applications, a short across the input terminals will suffice. Both
thermocouple inputs should be calibrated, even if they use the same type of thermocouple. An appropriate curve must be selected and room temperature compensation
must be turned on before calibration can be started.
Follow this procedure to calibrate room temperature compensation:
For best results, the calibration temperature should be close to the measurement temperature that requires best accuracy.

1. Attach a thermocouple sensor or direct short across the input terminals of the
thermocouple input. See FIGURE 3-8 for polarity.
2. Place the instrument away from drafts. If calibrating using a short, place an accurate room-temperature thermometer near the terminal block.
3. Allow the instrument to warm up for at least ½ hr without moving or handling
the sensor.
4. If calibrating with a short, skip to step 6, otherwise insert the thermocouple into
the ice-bath, liquid nitrogen, helium Dewar, or other known, fixed temperature.
5. Read the displayed temperature. If the temperature display is not as expected,
check to be sure that the thermocouple is making good thermal contact. If possible, add a thermal mass to the end of the thermocouple.
6. Press Input Setupand select the corresponding sensor input. Scroll down to the
Room Calibration parameter and press Enter.
7. The current temperature reading is displayed in kelvin. Press Enter to enter Number Entry mode. Enter the true temperature that the thermocouple should read.
If input is shorted, then enter the actual room temperature measured by the
thermometer. Press Enter to save the value.
8. To verify calibration, check that the temperature reading for the calibrated input
matches the room temperature calibration setting value.
Any previous calibration can be cleared using the Clear Calibration submenu.

4.4.6 Capacitance
Sensor Input Setup
(Model 3061 Only)

When a Model 3061 capacitance option is installed in the Model 350, a setting of
Capacitance becomes available under the Sensor Type parameter in the Input Setup
menu. The standard sensor inputs can still be used when the capacitance option is
installed, but the capacitance and standard inputs cannot be used simultaneously.
Refer to section 7.4.2 to install the Model 3061.
Capacitive sensors in the Model 350 do not support temperature conversion; therefore temperature response curves cannot be selected. Any feature of the Model 350
that requires temperature to operate is not supported with the option card. Refer to
section 3.5.8 for more information on using the Model 3061.
4.4.6.1 Range Selection
The capacitance option input has two input voltage ranges, 15 nF and 150 nF. The
lower range is specified to 15 nF, but can read up to 25 nF, and is recommended for
CS-401 series sensors. The higher range is specified to 150 nF, but can read up to
250 nF, and is recommended for CS-510 series sensors.

4.4.6.2 Temperature Coefficient Selection
Capacitance sensors can have both a positive and negative temperature coefficient
(slope). They have a positive temperature coefficient at very low temperatures and a
negative temperature coefficient at warmer temperature. Sensor data sheets detail
where the coefficient changes. There is often a temperature range where the sensor is
not usable. Temperature control is impossible if the Model 350 does not know which
slope the sensor is on. System overheating can result if the wrong coefficient is chosen. The user must select a temperature coefficient before control is switched to the
capacitance input.

4.4.6.3 Control Channel Changes
The capacitance input continues control at a stable temperature established with
another sensor. Allow temperature to stabilize for one hour after large temperature
changes to allow capacitance sensor recovery.
When the control channel is changed to the capacitance input, the Model 350 automatically changes the control setpoint to the present capacitance reading. It is not
necessary for the user to write down the capacitance value and en-ter a new setpoint.
Control parameters, P and I, may need to be changed for stable control.

TABLE 4-11 Sensor curves

Once the input is configured (section 4.4), you may choose a temperature curve. Any
standard or user curve that matches the format of the sensor type configured for a
given input will be available under the Curve parameter in the Input Setup menu for
that input. You are also given the choice of None. When set to None, front panel readings configured for kelvin or Celsius will display the NOCURV message and the interface will report 0 K and –273.15 °C for KRDG and CRDG queries, respectively. Data
points for standard curves are detailed in Appendix C.

4.4.9 Filter

The reading filter applies exponential smoothing to the sensor input readings. If the
filter is turned on for a sensor input, all reading values for that input are filtered. The
filter is a running average so it does not change the update rate of an input. Filtered
readings are not used for control functions but they are used for all input features
including Max/Min.
The number of filter points determines filter bandwidth. One filter point corresponds
to one new reading on that input. A larger number of points does more smoothing,
but also slows the instruments response to real changes in temperature. The default
number of filter points is 8, which settles to within six time constants of a step
change value in 45 readings, or 4.5 s.

4.4.9 Filter

The time constant (time it takes to settle to within 36.8% of the step value after a step
change) for a given number of filter points can be derived using the following formula:
TC = 0.1 / (ln (N / (N - 1)), where TC is one time constant, and N is the number of filter
points. A reading is usually considered settled after six time constants. TABLE 4-12
shows a sampling of filter settings and the resulting time constant, settle time, and
equivalent noise bandwidth.

The filter window is a limit for restarting the filter. If a single reading is different from
the filter value by more than the limit, the instrument will assume the change was
intentional and restart the filter. Filter window is set in percent of full scale range.
When the Model 3062 4-channel scanner option card is installed, the time it takes to
get a new reading is increased if more than one scanner channel is enabled or a 
channel is configured for a range that requires a reduced update rate. This reduction
in update rate modifies the time constant of the filter. The time constant of the filter
can be derived using the formula TC = T/(In(N/(N-1)), where TC is one time constant, T
is the update rate of the channel in seconds per reading, and N is the number of filter
points. Refer to section 4.4.7.2 for information on update rates of the Model 3062.

4.4.10 Input Name

To increase usability and reduce confusion, the Model 350 provides a means of
assigning a name to each of the four sensor inputs. The designated input name is used
on the front panel display whenever possible to indicate which sensor reading is
being displayed. It is also used in the output section of the custom display mode to
denote which sensor input is associated with the displayed output to form a control
loop. Refer to section 4.2.3 for Alpha-Numeric entry.

menu, determines the units used for capturing Max and Min.
Max and Min are always being captured, so there is no need to turn the feature on or

4.5 Output and
Control Setup

Model 350 Temperature Controller

Once the sensor inputs have been configured (section 4.4), the outputs can be configured. The Output Setup menu is used to create control loops for controlling temperature, whether using feedback (closed loop) or manually setting the output (open
loop). This section describes how to operate the output and control features, and how
to set control parameters. Each control parameter should be considered before turning on a control loop output or the instrument may not be able to perform the most
simple control functions. A good starting point is deciding which control loop to use,
whether to operate in open or closed control mode and which tuning mode is best for
the application. Other parameters fall into place once these have been chosen. 
Section 2.13 of this manual describes the principals of closed loop proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control.

4.5.1 Heater Outputs

4.5.1 Heater Outputs

75

Heater Outputs 1 and 2 are traditional control loop heater outputs for a cryogenic
temperature controller. Output 1 is designed for bulk heating and control at higher
temperatures, and can provide up to 75 W. Output 2 is designed for control at very
low temperatures, and can provide up to 1 W. They each include a large set of hardware and software features making them very flexible and easy to use. The heater
outputs are well-regulated DC outputs. This provides quiet, stable control for a broad
range of temperature control systems in a fully integrated package. The power ranges
for each output provide decade steps in power.
4.5.1.1 Max Current and Heater Resistance (Output 1 Only)
The Model 350 heater output is designed to work optimally into a 25 ) or 50 )
heater. The Heater Resistance and Max Current parameters work together to limit the
maximum available power into the heater. This is useful for preventing heater damage or limiting the maximum heater power into the system. When using a 25 ) or
50 ) heater, set the Heater Resistance parameter accordingly. The Max Current setting will then provide multiple discrete current limit values that correspond to common heater power ratings. The available current limits keep the output operating
within the voltage compliance limit to ensure the best possible resolution. These
parameters work with the Heater Range parameter (section 4.5.1.5.8) to provide
safety and flexibility.
If you are not using a standard heater resistance, set the Heater Resistance setting to
25 ) for any resistance less than 50 ), or to 50 ) for any higher heater resistance. The
user max current setting is useful when using a non-standard heater resistance value.
Refer to section 4.5.1.1.1 for more information on User Max Current. TABLE 4-14 provides examples of different heater resistances and max current settings, and the
resulting maximum heater power. The maximum heater powers in bold represent the
discrete current limits available under the Max Current setting for 25 ) and 50 )
heaters.

4.5.1.1.1 User Max Current
When using a heater that is not 25 ), 100 W or 50 ), 50 W the provided discrete current limits may not be appropriate. The User Max Current setting is available for this
case. The optimal maximum current value should be calculated based on the heater’s
power rating, or the maximum desired heater output power, whichever is lower. The
heater output compliance voltage (50 V for both heater outputs) should also be taken
into account in order to maximize heater setting resolution. This calculated current
limit can then be entered using the User Max Current setting.
To calculate the Max Current setting based on a heater or load power limit, calculate
current, I, using both of the following equations: I = Sqrt(P/R) and I = 50 V/ R where P is
the maximum allowable power, R is the heater resistance. The load power limit and
voltage compliance limit of the heater output (50 V) are in place at the same time, so
the lower calculated current is the correct Max Current setting.

4.5.1.4 Output Modes
The heater outputs can be configured in one of four output modes: Off, Closed Loop
PID, Zone, or Open Loop. The Off mode prevents current from being sourced to the
given output. Closed Loop PID is the mode most often used for controlling temperature. Zone mode builds on the Closed Loop mode by providing automatic changing of
control parameters at up to ten different temperature zones. Open Loop mode provides a means of applying a constant current (or voltage for outoputs 3 and 4)to the
output.

Interface Command: OUTMODE
4.5.1.4.1 Closed Loop PID Mode
The Closed Loop PID mode is the most commonly used closed loop control mode for
tightly controlling temperature using the heater outputs of the Model 350. In this
mode the controller attempts to keep the load at exactly the user-entered setpoint
temperature. To do this, it uses feedback from the control input sensor to calculate
and actively adjust the control output setting. The Model 350 uses a control algorithm called PID that refers to the three terms used to tune the control. Refer to section 4.4.10 for details on assigning a Control Input for the closed loop feedback. Refer
to section 2.13 and section 2.14 for a detailed discussion of PID control and 
manual tuning.
In Closed Loop PID mode, the controller will accept user-entered Proportional, Integral, and Derivative parameters to provide 3-term PID control. Manual output can be
used during closed loop control to add to the calculated PID control output.
Menu Navigation:
Output SetupQOutput (1, 2, 3, or 4)QOutput ModeQClosed Loop PID
4.5.1.4.2 Zone Mode
Optimal control parameter values are often different at different temperatures
within a system. Once control parameter values have been chosen for each temperature range (or zone), the instrument will update the control settings each time the
setpoint crosses into a new zone.

| www.lakeshore.com

78

cHAPTER 4: Operation

If desired, the control parameters can be changed manually, just like Closed Loop PID
mode, but they will be automatically updated once the setpoint crosses a zone boundary.

The control algorithm used for each zone is identical to that used in Closed Loop PID
mode. The Zone feature is useful by itself, but it is even more powerful when used
with other features. We recommend using zone mode with setpoint ramping (section
4.5.1.5.7). Refer to section 5.3 for details on setting up zones. Refer to section 2.13 for
a detailed discussion of PID control.
Menu Navigation:
Output SetupQOutput (1, 2, 3, or 4)QOutput ModeQZone
4.5.1.4.3 Open Loop Mode
Open Loop output mode allows you to directly set the output using only the 
Manual Output and Range parameters. This guarantees constant current to the load,
but it does not actively control temperature. Any change in the characteristics of the
load will cause a change in temperature.
You can configure any output to Open Loop mode. When an output is configured in
this mode, the Manual Output and Heater Range parameters become available in the
Output Setup menu for setting the output. For convenience, the Control Input parameter can be used to assign a sensor input, which then allows the output to be displayed on the front panel when using that sensor input’s display mode. When
displayed on the front panel, the Manual Output and Heater Range direct operation
keys can be used for one touch access to these settings. Refer to section 4.3.1 for
details on configuring display modes.
Since there is no sensor feedback in open loop mode, there is nothing to prevent the system from being overheated. We recommend using the Temperature Limit feature to help
protect the system from overheating. Refer to section 4.4.11 for temperature limits.

4.5.1.5 Control Parameters
Once the output mode is chosen, the control parameters can be used to begin controlling temperature. Control Input is used to create a control loop. The P, I, and D
parameters provide fine tuning of the control algorithm. Manual Output provides a
baseline output power about which to control. Setpoint is used to set the desired target temperature, and Heater Range is used to turn on the control output, as well as to
set the power range of the output. These parameters are described in detail in section
4.5.1.5.1 to section 4.5.1.5.8.
4.5.1.5.1 Control Input
For closed loop control (Closed Loop PID, Zone, Warm Up Supply) a control loop must
be created. A control loop consists of a control output for controlling the temperature,
and an input for feedback into the control algorithm. Use the Control Input parameter to assign the control input sensor to the desired output.
In the Monitor Out mode the Control Input parameter is used to determine the source
of the output voltage. In the Open Loop mode, the Control Input parameter can be set
simply for convenience in order to easily access the associated output’s Manual Output and Heater Range parameters using the Direct Operation keys. Refer to 
section 4.2.1.1 for details on Direct Operation keys.

turns the reset function off. The I setting is related to seconds by:
Isetting =1000/Iseconds
For example, a reset number setting of 20 corresponds to a time constant of 50 s. A
system will normally take several time constants to settle into the setpoint. The 50 s
time constant, if correct for the system being controlled, would result in a system that
stabilizes at a new setpoint in between 5 min and 10 min.
To set I, first configure the front panel display to show the desired control loop information, then use the I key on the front panel. A quick way to access the setting if the

the Model 350 derivative time constant is expressed in percent of ¼ the integral
time. The range is between 0% and 200%. Start with settings of 0%, 50%, or 100%,
and determine which setting gives you the type of control you desire. Do not be surprised if the setting you prefer is 0%. Note that by using a percent of integral time,
derivative scales automatically with changes in the integral value and does not have
to be revisited frequently.

Manual Output is a manual setting of the control output. It can function in two different ways depending on control mode. In open loop control mode, the Manual Output
is the only output to the load. You can directly set the control output from the front
panel or over the computer interface. In closed loop control mode, Manual Output is
added directly to the output of the PID control equation. In effect, the control equation operates about the Manual Output setting.
The Manual Output setting is in percent of full scale. Percent of full scale is defined as
percent of full-scale current or power on the selected heater range. Refer to
section 4.5.1.3 to set the Heater Out display. Available full scale current and power
are determined by the heater resistance, Max Current setting, and Heater Range.
Manual Output setting range is 0% to 100% with a resolution of 0.01%.
To set Manual Output, first configure the front panel display to show the desired control loop information, and then press Manual Output on the front panel. A quick way
to access the setting if the control loop information is not already being displayed is
to press A, B, C, or D on the front panel to temporarily display the control loop information while the new setting is entered. Refer to section 4.3 for details on configuring
the front panel display.
When an output is configured for Open Loop mode, the Manual Output setting is
available in the Output Setup menu. This is because in the Open Loop mode no Control Input (feedback sensor) is required, and if none is set then there would be no way
to use the Manual Output front panel key to set the output unless using the Custom
Display mode. The Control Input parameter can be assigned to a sensor input (that is

4.5.1.5.6 Setpoint
Use the Setpoint parameter to set the desired load temperature for a control loop.
Before entering a setpoint, a control loop must be created by configuring an input

Setpoint can be entered in either temperature units or sensor units, based on the sensor input’s Preferred Units setting. The Setpoint Ramping feature is available when
controlling in temperature units to provide smooth, continuous control from one
temperature to the next. Refer to section 4.4 for details on Input Setup. Refer to section 4.5.1.5.1 for details on assigning a Control Input. Refer to section 4.5.1.5.7 for
details on the Setpoint Ramping feature.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

4.5.1 Heater Outputs

Most applications require control in units of temperature. To control in units of temperature, set the Preferred Units parameter of the control input sensor to either kelvin or Celsius. When controlling in temperature, the available setting range of the
setpoint is limited by the Setpoint Limit parameter of the assigned temperature
curve. Refer to section 4.4.12 for details on setting the Preferred Units parameter.
Refer to section 5.8.1 for details on setting a curve Setpoint Limit.
The Setpoint Limit feature only limits the Setpoint entry. For even greater protection, the
Temperature Limit feature can be used to turn off all heater outputs if a sensor reading
above the specified temperature is observed. Refer to section 4.4.11 for details on the
Temperature Limit feature.

There are some instances when temperature control in sensor units may be desired,
for example when a temperature curve is not available. For these applications the
Model 350 can control temperature in sensor units. To control in sensor units, set the
Preferred Units parameter to Sensor. When controlling in sensor units, the Setpoint
resolution matches the display resolution for the sensor input type given in the specifications (section 1.6.1).
Temperature control in sensor units can be unpredictable since most sensors do not have
a linear response to temperature, and therefore have can have different sensitivity in different temperature ranges.

If you change the Preferred Units from Sensor to temperature (Kelvin or Celsius), or
from temperature to Sensor, the Model 350 uses the assigned temperature curve to
convert the Setpoint to the new control units. This provides minimal disruption in the
control output if you change the Preferred Units parameter while the control loop is
active.
Menu Navigation:
SetpointQ(See note below)
Default: 0.0000 K
Interface Command: SETP
When controlling in temperature, setpoint is limited by the control input temperature
curve’s Setpoint Limit. When controlling in sensor units, setpoint is limited by the limits of
the configured control sensor.

4.5.1.5.7 Setpoint Ramping
The Model 350 can generate a smooth setpoint ramp when the setpoint units are
expressed in temperature. You can set a ramp rate in degrees per minute with a range
of 0 to 100 and a resolution of 0.001. Once the ramping feature is turned on, its action
is initiated by a setpoint change. When you enter a new setpoint the instrument
changes the setpoint temperature from the old value to the new value at the ramp
rate. A positive ramp rate is always entered; it is used by the instrument to ramp
either up or down in temperature.
Always use the ramping feature to minimize temperature overshoot and undershoot.
When ramping is not used, a setpoint change can cause the error used by the PID
equation to become very large, which causes the I contribution of the control output
equation to become larger the longer the error exists. This will result in a large overshoot or undershoot once the setpoint temperature is reached, since the I contribution will only decrease when the error polarity is reversed. Use a ramp rate that keeps
the control output from reaching the extremes of 100% or 0% while ramping for
optimal results.

82

cHAPTER 4: Operation

The ramping feature is useful by itself, but it is even more powerful when used with
other features. Setpoint ramps are often used with zone control mode. As temperature is ramped through different temperature zones, control parameters are automatically selected for best control. Ramps can be initiated and status read back using
a computer interface. During computer-controlled experiments, the instrument generates the setpoint ramp while the computer is busy taking necessary data.
When an incomplete ramp is shut off, the setpoint will remain on the most current setting
(the reading will not jump to the end of the ramp).
If the input type or input curve is changed while a ramp is in progress, both ramping and
the heater are turned off.
If Ramp is on and the setpoint is set to sensor units, the ramping function will remain on
but when another setpoint is entered, the setpoint goes directly to the new setpoint

To stop a ramp, when the desired control loop is displayed, press Setpoint, then
immediately press Enter. This stops the ramp at the current setpoint, but leaves the
ramping function activated. To continue the ramp, enter a new setpoint. Refer to section 4.5.1.5.6 for details on setting the Setpoint parameter.
4.5.1.5.8 Heater Range
The Heater Range setting is used for turning a control output on, as well as setting the
output power range for the heater outputs. All four outputs provide an Off setting for
turning the output off. The heater outputs, 1 and 2, provide five ranges of settings
which provide decade steps in power, based on the maximum output power available
to the connected heater. Range 5 provides the maximum power, and each successive
lower range provides 10 times less power than the last. Refer to section 2.14.1 for
details on how to calculate the maximum output power. The analog outputs, 3 and 4,
do not have multiple output ranges, and only provide an On setting for enabling the
output.
While controlling tempertature, the following will cause the heater range to automatically turn off:
D Exceeding the Temperature Limit setting
D Setup changes to the control input
D Power loss with Power Up Enable feature turned off
D Input errors such as T. Over, T. Under, S. Over, and S. Under
Available full scale current and power for output 1 are determined by the heater resistance, Max Current setting, and Heater Range.

Specifications of the heater outputs are provided in section 1.6. Heater theory of
operation is provided in section 2.4. Various heater installation considerations are
provided in section 3.6.

The ALL OFF key is provided as a means of shutting down all control outputs with one
key. It is equivalent to setting the Heater Range parameter of all outputs to Off.
This function is always active even if the keypad is locked or when it is in remote mode.

4.5.2 Analog Outputs

The analog outputs, 3 and 4, are variable DC voltage sources that have a range from 
–10 V to +10 V. The voltage is generated by a 16-bit D/A converter with resolution of
0.3 mV or 0.003% of full scale. This output can be configured to a Closed Loop PID,
Zone, Open Loop, Warm Up Supply, or Monitor Out mode. The Closed Loop PID mode
can be used to control temperature. It can also be set up for bipolar PID control, which
is useful when controlling a thermoelectric device. Refer to section 5.4 for more information on setting up thermoelectric devices. The Open Loop mode can be used to set
the output to a specific, constant value. Refer to section 4.5.1.4.3 for details on Open
Loop Mode. The Warm Up Supply mode uses the output to drive the programming
input for an external power supply for the purpose of rapidly warming a system to a
user-specified temperature. The Monitor Out mode uses the output to provide a voltage proportional to an input sensor reading to be used by an external device such as a
data logger.
The voltage output is designed to provide up to 1 W into a 100 ) heater. The output is current limited to slightly over 100 mA, and therefore, a heater value less than 100 ) can
drive the output into current limit. This condition will not damage the output, but it can
result in discontinuous temperature control.

4.5.2.1 Warm Up Supply
Warm Up Supply mode is designed for controlling an external power supply used for
rapidly increasing the temperature in the controlled system, for example, to bring a
system to room temperature in order to change samples. Refer to section 5.5 for more
information on warm up supply operation. Refer to section 3.6.5 for the procedure to
install an external power supply for warm up supply mode.

The keypad lock feature prevents accidental changes to parameter values. When the
keypad is locked, some parameter values may be viewed, but most cannot be changed
from the front panel. All Off is the only keypad function that remains active when the
keypad is locked.
A three-digit keypad lock code locks and unlocks the keypad. The factory default code
is 123. The code can be changed only through the computer interface. If instrument
parameters are reset to default values, the lock code resets also. The instrument cannot reset from the front panel with the keypad locked.
To lock the keypad, press and hold Enter for 5 s. Use the numeric keypad to enter the
three-digit lock code. If the lock code is accepted, *** Keypad Locked *** will be displayed for 3 s, and the display will return to normal. Changes attempted to any
parameters result in a brief display of the *** Keypad Locked *** message.
To unlock the keypad, press and hold Enter for 5 s. Use the numeric keypad to enter
the three-digit lock code. If the lock code is accepted, *** Keypad Unlocked *** will be
displayed for 3 s and the display will return to normal. All Model 350 parameters are

Chapter 5: Advanced Operation
5.1 General

This chapter provides information on the advanced operation of the Model 350 temperature controller.

5.2 Autotune

The Model 350 can automate the tuning process of typical cryogenic systems with
the Autotune feature. For additional information about the algorithm refer 
to section 2.15.
Before initiating the Autotune process, properly configure the cooling system with
control input sensor and heater output to make it capable of closed-loop control.
Assign the control sensor with a valid temperature response curve. Also determine an
appropriate heater range as described in section 2.14.1. The system must be coarsely
maintaining temperature within 5 K of the setpoint where new tuning parameters
are desired in order for the Autotuning process to initiate. Autotune works only with
one control loop at a time and does not set the manual output or heater range. For
autotuning to work properly on a control loop with a scanner input assigned (Model
3062 4-channel scanner option), only that scanner input channel can be enabled; all
other scanner input channels must be disabled.
To initiate the Autotune process, press Autotune, then select an Autotune mode.
There are three Autotune modes available. They result in slightly different system
characteristics. Autotune PI is recommended for most applications.
D

D

D

Autotune P: sets only the P parameter value. I and D are set to 0 no matter what
the initial values are. This mode is recommended for systems that have very long
lag times or nonlinearity that prevents stable PI control. Expect some overshoot
or undershoot of the setpoint and stable temperature control below the setpoint
value.
Autotune PI: sets values for both P and I parameters. D is set to 0. This mode is
recommended for stable control at a constant temperature. It may take slightly
longer to stabilize after setpoint change than Auto PID. Expect some overshoot or
undershoot of the setpoint and stable temperature control at the setpoint value.
Autotune PID: sets values for P, I and D parameters. D is always set to 100%. This
mode is recommended when setpoint changes are frequent, but temperature is
allowed to stabilize between changes. Stability at setpoint may be worse than
Autotune PI in noisy systems. Expect slightly less overshoot or undershoot than
the other modes and control at the setpoint value.

When the Autotune process is initiated, the P, I, D, and Manual Output parameters are
removed from the display and the “Autotuning” message appears in the lower right
corner. Below the Autotuning message, the current status of the process is displayed.
The status message blinks to indicate that the algorithm is still processing. If an error
occurs, the status message stops blinking and displays an error message containing
the stage in which Autotune failed. See TABLE 5-1 for a description of the Autotune
stages, reasons for failure, and possible solutions. When the process completes successfully, the previous P, I, and D parameters are replaced by the newly acquired values. To cancel the Autotune process, press Autotune, and choos Yes to the “cancel
Autotune” prompt.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

5.3 Zone Settings

5.3 Zone Settings

87

The Model 350 allows you to establish up to ten custom contiguous temperature
zones where the controller will automatically use pre-programmed values for PID,
heater range, manual output, ramp rate, and control input. Zone control can be active
for both control loops at the same time. Configure the zones using 1 as the lowest to
10 as the highest zone. Zone boundaries are always specified in kelvin (K). The bottom
of the first zone is always 0 K; therefore, only the upper limit is required for all subsequent zones. Make a copy of FIGURE 5-1 to plan your zones.
To use the programmed zones, the output mode must be set to Zone (refer to section
4.5.1.4.2 to set up Zone mode). In Zone mode, the instrument will update the control
settings each time the setpoint crosses into a new zone. If you change the settings
manually, the controller will use the new setting while it is in the same zone, and will
update to the programmed zone table settings when the setpoint crosses into a 
new zone.
The zone settings include a Control Input parameter for each temperature zone. This
allows a different feedback sensor to be used for each temperature zone. For example, a diode sensor can be used while cooling down from room temperature to 10 K, at
which point the Control Input could be switched to a Cernox™ sensor for temperatures under 10 K.
To illustrate how the control parameters are updated in Zone mode, consider the
zone settings from the table below. Starting from room temperature (about 300 K),
and setting a setpoint of 2 K (with Setpoint Ramping turned On), the setpoint will
begin ramping at the current setpoint Ramp Rate, then once the setpoint crosses
100 K, the control parameters from Zone 8 will be used. The setpoint ramp will then
continue toward 2 K at a rate of 20 K/min until crossing 50 K, when the control
parameters from Zone 7 are loaded. This pattern will continue until the final setpoint
value of 2 K is reached, or another setpoint is entered. Note that Input B will be used in
all zones greater than 10 K (zones 4 to 8), and Input A will be used in all zones below
10 K (zones 1-3).

Sensor accuracy and placement will affect how smoothly the transition from one feedback sensor to another is performed. A large difference between the temperature readings of each sensor at the time of transition could cause a temporary instability in the
temperature control due to the sudden large error introduced into the control equation.
It is highly recommended to use the Setpoint Ramping feature when using the Control
Input zone parameter to change sensor inputs. Otherwise a setpoint change may cause a
control input sensor to be used outside of its usable range, which will cause an overload
condition to shut down the control loop.

5.4 Bipolar Control

89

The most common type of temperature control output device is a resistive heater,
which requires only unipolar output, since they will add heat regardless of the polarity of the excitation voltage. There are, however, temperature control devices that are
bipolar. These devices, such as thermoelectric devices, can work in both polarities,
moving heat from one side of the device to the other when a current is applied. Therefore, a surface can be heated or cooled using a bipolar temperature control device. For
these types of bipolar devices, the Model 350 features a bipolar control mode. In this
mode, the Model 350 is configured to drive these devices to control temperature
using Outputs 3 and 4. Refer to section 2.17 for more information about thermoelectric devices.
To use Outputs 3 and 4 for bipolar control, set the polarity to Bipolar. The Closed Loop
PID control mode can then be used to control a thermoelectric device, providing a
control output of -10 V to +10 V. Refer to section 2.11 for information on thermoelectric devices. Refer to section 3.6.5.4 for information on scaling the output for voltages
less than 10 V.

Once Warm Up Supply Mode is configured, press Setpoint and set the desired temperature, then press Heater Range and set the range to On to activate the output. The
front panel display must be configured to show the Warm Up control loop for the Setpoint and Heater Range keys to be used. Refer to section 4.2 and section 4.3 for

Auto-Off: once the Heater Range is set to on, the Warm Up Percentage voltage is
applied to the output (section 5.5.1) and the output stays on until the control
input temperature reaches the control setpoint. The output will then be turned
off (0 V), and the Heater Range setting will automatically be set to Off, effectively
turning off all temperature control for the control loop. If the Heater Range is
again manually set to On, the cycle will begin again, and the output will turn on
and stay on until the control input temperature reaches the setpoint again.

Once the Heater Range is set to on, the Warm Up Percentage voltage is applied to
the output until the control input temperature reaches the setpoint. Then the
output will turn off (0 V) until the temperature falls 1 K below the setpoint, at
which point the the Warm Up Percentage voltage is again applied to the output.
The Heater Range will never be automatically set to Off in this mode.

In Monitor Out mode, the unpowered analog output (3 or 4) will track the assigned
control input according to the scaling parameters you enter. A common use for this
function would be to send a voltage proportional to temperature to a data acquisition
system.
The Control Input parameter setting determines which sensor input is tracked by the
output. The remaining parameters detailed in this section dictate how the output
value is determined.
An output configured to Monitor Out mode is not affected by the ALL OFF key, as it does
not have a Heater Range setting, and by design is always enabled.

5.6.1.1 Polarity and Monitor Out Scaling Parameters
In the Monitor Out and Open Loop modes, the unpowered analog outputs can be configured as either unipolar (0 V to +10 V) or bipolar (–10 V to +10 V) outputs. In bipolar
mode, the Monitor Out –10 V setting determines the temperature or sensor value at
which the output should be –10 V. In unipolar mode, the Monitor Out 0 V setting
determines the temperature or sensor value at which the output should be 0 V. The
Monitor Out +10 V setting determines the temperature or sensor value at which the
output should be +10 V in either unipolar or bipolar modes.

5.7 Alarms and
Relays
5.7.1 Alarms

Each input of the Model 350 has high and low alarm capability. Input reading data
from any source can be compared to the alarm setpoint values. A reading higher than
the high alarm setpoint triggers the high alarm for that input. A reading lower than
the low alarm setpoint triggers the low alarm for that input.

5.7.1.1 Alarm Annunciators
The Alarm LED annunciator steadily displays when any alarm that is enabled also has
the Visible parameter enabled. The annunciator flashes when any alarm that has the
Visible parameter enabled activates. An input need not be displayed for the system
Alarm annunciator to indicate input alarm status, but if the input is displayed on the
front panel, then the reading will alternate between the alarm status message and
the actual reading. If the Audible parameter is set to On for an enabled alarm, then
the beeper inside the instrument will sound when the alarm activates. The two relays
on the Model 350 can also be tied to alarm functions as described in section 5.7.2.
You may want to set the Visible parameter to Off if there is no need for showing the
alarm state on the front panel, for instance, if you are using the alarm function to trigger a relay. The Audible parameter can be set to Off as well to keep the audible alarm
from sounding when an alarm is triggered.

Model 350 Temperature Controller

Latching Alarms: often used to detect faults in a system or experiment that
requires operator intervention. The alarm state remains visible to the operator
for diagnostics even if the alarm condition is removed. Relays often signal remote
monitors, or for added safety take critical equipment off line. You can clear a
latched alarm by pressing Alarm and selecting Yes to the Reset Alarm prompt.
Select No to the Reset Alarm prompt to enter the Alarm Setup menu.
Non-Latching Alarms: often tied to relay operation to control part of a system or
experiment. The alarm state follows the reading value. The dead band parameter
can prevent relays from turning on and off repeatedly when the sensor input
reading is near an alarm setpoint. 

FIGURE 5-5 illustrates the interaction between alarm setpoint and dead band in
non-latching operation. With the high alarm setpoint at 100 K and the dead band
at 5 K, the high alarm triggers when sensor input temperature increases to 100 K,
and it will not deactivate until temperature drops to 95 K. In addition, the same
5 K dead band is applied to the low alarm setpoint as well.

5.7.2 Relays

There are two relays on the Model 350 numbered 1 and 2. They are most commonly
thought of as alarm relays, but they may be manually controlled also. Relay assignments are configurable as shown in FIGURE 5-6. Two relays can be used with one sensor input for independent high and low operation, or each can be assigned to a
different input.

When using relays with alarm operation, set up alarms first. The relays are rated for
30 VDC and 3 A. Their terminals are in the detachable terminal block on the
Model 350 rear panel.
In the Off mode, the relay is un-energized, leaving the normally open (NO) contacts
open and the normally closed (NC) contacts closed. In the On mode, the relay is energized, so the NO contacts will be closed and the NC contacts will be open. In the Alarm
mode the relay will activate based on the state of the configured Alarm Input sensor.
When the Alarm to Follow parameter is set to Low, the relay will energize if the configured Alarm Input sensor goes into a low alarm state. If it is set to High, the relay will
energize if the configured Alarm Input sensor goes into a high alarm state. If the
Alarm to Follow parameter is set to Both, the relay will energize if the configured
Alarm Input sensor goes into either a low alarm or a high alarm state.

5.8 Curve
Numbers and
Storage

Model 350 Temperature Controller

The Model 350 has 20 standard curve locations, numbered 1 through 20. At present,
not all locations are occupied by curves; the others are reserved for future updates. If
a standard curve location is in use, the curve can be viewed using the view operation.
Standard curves cannot be changed by the user, and reserved locations are not available for user curves.

5.8.1 Curve Header Parameters

95

The Model 350 has 39 user curve locations, numbered 21 through 59. Each location
can hold from 2 to 200 data pairs (breakpoints), including a value in sensor units and
a corresponding value in kelvin. Using fewer than 200 breakpoints will not increase
the number of available curve locations. SoftCal™-generated curves are stored in
user curve locations.

5.8.1 Curve Header
Parameters

Each curve has parameters that are used for identification and to allow the instrument to use the curve effectively. The parameters must be set correctly before a curve
can be used for temperature conversion or temperature control.

5.8.2 Curve
Breakpoints

Setpoint Limit: limits the control setpoint to values less than or equal to this setting. A setpoint limit can be included with every curve. Default is 375 K. Enter a
setting of 9999 K if no limit is needed.
Temperature Coefficient: the temperature coefficient is derived by the Model 350
from the first two breakpoints. The user does not enter this setting. If it is not correct, check for proper entry of the first two breakpoints. A positive coefficient
indicates that the sensor signal increases with increasing temperature. A 
negative coefficient indicates that the sensor signal decreases with increasing
temperature.

Temperature response data of a calibrated sensor must be reduced to a table of
breakpoints before entering it into the instrument. A curve consists of 2 to 200 breakpoints and each breakpoint consists of one value in sensor units and one temperature
value in kelvin. The Model 350 uses linear interpolation to calculate temperature
between breakpoints. The instrument will show T.OVER or T.UNDER on the display if
the sensor reading is outside the range of the breakpoints. Sensor units are defined by
the format setting in TABLE 5-3.
Breakpoint setting resolution is six digits in temperature. Most temperature values
are entered with 0.001 resolution. Temperature values of 1000 K and greater can be
entered to 0.01 resolution. Temperature values below 10 K can be entered with
0.0001 resolution. Temperature range for curve entry is 0K to 9999.99 K.

Setting resolution is also six digits in sensor units. The curve format parameter
defines the range and resolution in sensor units as shown in TABLE 5-3. The sensor
type determines the practical setting resolution. TABLE 5-4 lists recommended sensor units resolutions.
Enter the breakpoints with the sensor units value increasing as point number
increases. There should not be any breakpoint locations left blank in the middle of a
curve. The search routine in the Model 350 interprets a blank breakpoint as the end of
the curve.

when temperature is below that point.
To convert curves published in Celsius to kelvin, add 273.15 to the temperature in

5.10 SoftCal™

The Model 350 allows you to perform inexpensive sensor calibrations with a set of
algorithms called SoftCal™. The two SoftCal™ algorithms in the Model 350 work with
DT-400 Series silicon diode sensors and platinum sensors. They create a new temperature response curve from the standard curve and known data points that you
entered. The new curve loads into one of the user curve locations (21 to 59) in the
instrument. The following sections describe the data points you need to supply and
the expected accuracy of the resulting curves.
A feature similar to SoftCal™ is available for compensating thermocouples using the
Curve Handler® program.

Both DT-400 Series and platinum SoftCal™ algorithms require a standard curve that
is already present in the Model 350. When you enter the type of sensor being calibrated, the correct standard curve must be selected. When calibration is complete,
you must assign the new curve to an input. The Model 350 does not automatically
assign the newly generated curve to either input.
Calibration data points must be entered into the Model 350. These calibration points
are normally measured at easily obtained temperatures like the boiling point of cryogens. Each algorithm operates with 1, 2, or 3 calibration points. The range of
improved accuracy increases with more points.
There are two ways to get SoftCal™ calibration data points: you can record the
response of an unknown sensor at well controlled temperatures, or you can purchase
a SoftCal™ calibrated sensor from Lake Shore. There are advantages to both methods.
D

D

5.10.1 SoftCal™ With
Silicon Diode Sensors

User: when you can provide stable calibration temperatures with the sensor
installed, SoftCal™ calibration eliminates errors in the sensor measurement as
well as the sensor. Thermal gradients, instrument accuracy, and other measurement errors can be significant to some users. Calibration can be no better than
user-supplied data.
Purchased: Lake Shore sensors with SoftCal™ calibration include a set of calibration points in the calibration report. The SoftCal™ calibration points are generated in a controlled calibration facility at Lake Shore for best accuracy. The
calibration points can be entered into the Model 350 so it can generate a curve. If
the CalCurve™ service is purchased with the calibrated sensor, the curve is also
generated at the factory and can be entered like any other curve.

Lake Shore silicon diode sensors incorporate remarkably uniform sensing elements
that exhibit precise, monotonic, and repeatable temperature response. For example,
the Lake Shore DT-400 Series of silicon diode sensors have a repeatable temperature
response from 2 K to 475 K. These sensors closely follow a standard curve . SoftCal™ is
an inexpensive way to improve the accuracy of an already predictable sensor.
A unique characteristic of DT-400 Series diodes is that their temperature responses
pass through 28 K at almost exactly the same voltage. This improves SoftCal™ algorithm operation by providing an extra calibration data point. It also explains why
SoftCal™ calibration specifications are divided into two temperature ranges, above
and below 28 K. See FIGURE 5-8.

Point 2: calibration data point at or near the boiling point of nitrogen (77.35 K).
Temperatures outside 50 K to 100 K are not allowed. This data point improves
accuracy between 28 K and 100 K. Points 2 and 3 together improve accuracy to

A SoftCal™ calibration is only as good as the accuracy of the calibration points. The
accuracies listed for SoftCal™ assume ±0.01 K for 4.2 K (liquid helium), ±0.05 K for
77.35 K (liquid nitrogen), and 305 K (room temperature) points. Users performing the
SoftCal™ with Lake Shore instruments should note that the boiling point of liquid
cryogen, though accurate, is affected by atmospheric pressure. Use calibrated standard sensors if possible.
One-point SoftCal™ calibrations for applications under 30 K are performed at liquid
helium (4.2 K) temperature. Accuracy for the DT-470-SD-13 diode is ±0.5 K from 2 K
to <30 K with no accuracy change above 30 K.
Two-point SoftCal™ calibrations for applications above 30 K are performed at liquid

One, two, or three calibration data points can be used. If you are using one point, the
algorithm shifts the entire curve up or down to meet the single point. If you are using
two points, the algorithm has enough information to tilt the curve, achieving good
accuracy between the data points. The third point extends the improved accuracy to
span all three points.

Point 1: calibration data point at or near the boiling point of nitrogen (77.35 K).
Acceptable temperature entries are 50 K to 100 K.
Point 2: calibration data point near room temperature (305 K). Acceptable temperature entries are 200 K to 300 K.
Point 3: calibration data point at a higher temperature (480 K). Acceptable temperature entries are 400 K to 600 K.

A SoftCal™ calibration is only as good as the accuracy of the calibration points. The
accuracies listed for SoftCal™ assume ±0.05 K for 77.35 K (liquid nitrogen) and 305 K
(room temperature) points. If you are performing the SoftCal™ with Lake Shore
instruments, note that the boiling point of liquid cryogen, though accurate, is
affected by atmospheric pressure. Use calibrated standard sensors if possible.
One-point SoftCal™ calibrations with platinum sensors have no specified accuracy.
Two-point SoftCal™ calibrations for applications above 70 K are performed at liquid
nitrogen (77.35 K) and room temperature (305 K). Accuracy for the PT-102, PT-103, or
PT-111 platinum sensor is as follows:

Chapter 6: Computer Interface
Operation
6.1 General

This chapter provides operational instructions for the computer interface for the
Lake Shore Model 350 temperature controller. Each of the three computer interfaces
provided with the Model 350 permit remote operation. The first is the IEEE–488
interface described in section 6.2. The second is the USB interface described in 
section 6.3. The third is the Ethernet interface described in section 6.4. The three
interfaces share a common set of commands detailed in section 6.6. Only one of the
interfaces can be used at a time.

6.2 IEEE-488
Interface

The IEEE–488 interface is an instrumentation bus with hardware and programming
standards that simplify instrument interfacing. The Model 350 IEEE–488 interface
complies with the IEEE-488.2 standard and incorporates its functional, electrical,
and mechanical specifications unless otherwise specified in this manual.
All instruments on the interface bus perform one or more of the interface functions of
Talker, Listener, or Bus Controller. A Talker transmits data onto the bus to other
devices. A Listener receives data from other devices through the bus. The Bus Controller designates to the devices on the bus which function to perform. The Model 350
performs the functions of Talker and Listener, but it cannot be a Bus Controller. The
Bus Controller is the digital computer that tells the Model 350 which functions to
perform.

TABLE 6-1 Model 350 IEEE-488 interface capabilities
and their subsets

Instruments are connected to the IEEE–488 bus by a 24-conductor connector cable
as specified by the standard (section 8.10.1). Cables can be ordered from Lake Shore
as IEEE-488 Cable Kit 4005, or they can be purchased from other electronic suppliers.
Cable lengths are limited to 2 m (6.6 ft) for each device and 20 m (65.6 ft) for the
entire bus. The Model 350 can drive a bus with up to ten loads. If more instruments or
cable length is required, a bus expander must be used.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

6.2.1 Changing 
IEEE-488 Interface
Parameters

The IEEE-488 address must be set from the front panel before communication with
the instrument can be established.

6.2.2 Remote/Local
Operation

Normal operations from the keypad are referred to as local operations. The
Model 350 can also be configured for remote operations via the IEEE-488 interface or
the Remote/Local key. The Remote/Local key will toggle between remote and local
operation. During remote operations, the remote annunciator LED will be illuminated, and operations from the keypad will be disabled.

6.2.3 IEEE-488.2
Command Structure

The Model 350 supports several command types. These commands are divided 
into four groups.

2. Common (section 6.2.3.2).
3. Device Specific (section 6.2.3.3).
4. Message Strings (section 6.2.3.4).
6.2.3.1 Bus Control Commands
A bus control command can either be a universal or an addressed bus control. A universal command addresses all devices on the bus. Universal commands include uniline and multiline commands. A uniline command (message) asserts only a single
signal line. The Model 350 recognizes two of these messages from the Bus Controller:
Remote (REN) and Interface Clear (IFC). The Model 350 sends one uniline command:
Service Request (SRQ).
D
D
D

REN (Remote): puts the Model 350 into remote mode
IFC (Interface Clear): stops current operation on the bus
SRQ (Service Request): tells the bus controller that the Model 350 needs interface
service

A multiline command asserts a group of signal lines. All devices equipped to implement such commands do so simultaneously upon command transmission. These
commands transmit with the Attention (ATN) line asserted low. The Model 350 recognizes two multiline commands:
D
D

LLO (Local Lockout): prevents the use of instrument front panel controls
DCL (Device Clear): clears Model 350 interface activity and puts it into a bus idle
state

Finally, addressed bus control commands are multiline commands that must include
the Model 350 listen address before the instrument responds. Only the addressed
device responds to these commands. The Model 350 recognizes three of the
addressed bus control commands:
D
D

Model 350 Temperature Controller

SDC (Selective Device Clear): the SDC command performs essentially the same
function as the DCL command, except that only the addressed device responds
GTL (Go To Local): the GTL command is used to remove instruments from the
remote mode. With some instruments, GTL also unlocks front panel controls if
they were previously locked out with the LLO command.

6.2.3 IEEE-488.2 Command Structure

D

107

SPE (Serial Poll Enable) and SPD (Serial Poll Disable): serial polling accesses the
Service Request Status Byte Register. This status register contains important
operational information from the unit requesting service. The SPD command
ends the polling sequence.

6.2.3.2 Common Commands
Common commands are addressed commands that create commonality between
instruments on the bus. All instruments that comply with the IEEE-488 standard
share these commands and their format. Common commands all begin with an asterisk. They generally relate to bus and instrument status and identification. Common
query commands end with a question mark (?). Model 350 common commands are
detailed in section 6.6.1 and summarized in TABLE 6-6.
6.2.3.3 Device Specific Commands
Device specific commands are addressed commands. The Model 350 supports a variety of device specific commands to program instruments remotely from a digital
computer and to transfer measurements to the computer. Most device specific commands also work if performed from the front panel. Model 350 device specific commands are detailed in section 6.6.1 and summarized in TABLE 6-6.
6.2.3.4 Message Strings
A message string is a group of characters assembled to perform an interface function.
There are three types of message strings: commands, queries and responses. The
computer issues command and query strings through user programs, and the instrument issues responses. Two or more command strings or queries can be chained
together in one communication, but they must be separated by a semi-colon (;). The
total communication string must not exceed 255 characters in length.
A command string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to perform
a function or change a parameter setting. When a command is issued, the computer
is acting as talker and the instrument as listener. The format is:
<command mnemonic><space><parameter data><terminator>.
Command mnemonics and parameter data necessary for each one is described in 
section 6.6.1. A terminator must be sent with every message string.
A query string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument which response
to send. Queries are issued similar to commands with the computer acting as talker
and the instrument as listener. The query format is:
<query mnemonic><?><space><parameter data><terminator>.
Query mnemonics are often the same as commands with the addition of a question
mark. Parameter data is often unnecessary when sending queries. Query mnemonics
and parameter data if necessary is described in section 6.6.1. A terminator must be
sent with every message string. Issuing a query does not initiate a response from the
instrument.
A response string is sent by the instrument only when it is addressed as a talker and
the computer becomes the listener. The instrument will respond only to the last query
it receives. The response can be a reading value, status report or the present value of a
parameter. Response data formats are listed along with the associated queries 
in section 6.6.1.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

6.2.4 Status System
Overview

The Model 350 implements a status system compliant with the IEEE-488.2 standard.
The status system provides a method of recording and reporting instrument information and is typically used to control the Service Request (SRQ) interrupt line. A diagram of the status system is shown in FIGURE 6-1. The status system is made up of
status register sets, the Status Byte register, and the Service Request Enable register.
Each register set consists of three types of registers: condition, event, and enable.
6.2.4.1 Condition Registers
Each register set (except the Standard Event Register set) includes a condition register as shown in FIGURE 6-1. The condition register constantly monitors the instrument status. The data bits are real-time and are not latched or buffered. The register
is read-only.
6.2.4.2 Event Registers
Each register set includes an event register as shown in FIGURE 6-1. Bits in the event
register correspond to various system events and latch when the event occurs. When
an event bit is set, subsequent events corresponding to that bit are ignored. Set bits
remain latched until the register is cleared by a query command (such as *ESR?) or a
*CLS command. The register is read-only.
6.2.4.3 Enable Registers
Each register set includes an enable register as shown in FIGURE 6-1. An enable register determines which bits in the corresponding event register will set the summary
bit for the register set in the Status Byte. You may write to or read from an enable register. Each event register bit is logically ANDed to the corresponding enable bit of the
enable register. When you set an enable register bit, and the corresponding bit is set
in the event register, the output (summary) of the register will be set, which in turn
sets the summary bit of the Status Byte register.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

6.2.4.4 Status Byte Register
The Status Byte register, typically referred to as the Status Byte, is a non-latching,
read-only register that contains all of the summary bits from the register sets. The
status of the summary bits are controlled from the register sets as explained in section 6.2.4.1 to section 6.2.4.3. The Status Byte also contains the Request for Service
(RQS)/Master Summary Status (MSS) bit. This bit is used to control the Service
Request hardware line on the bus and to report if any of the summary bits are set via
the *STB? command. The status of the RQS/MSS bit is controlled by the summary bits
and the Service Request Enable Register.
6.2.4.5 Service Request Enable Register
The Service Request Enable Register determines which summary bits in the Status
Byte will set the RQS/MSS bit of the Status Byte. You may write to or read from the Service Request Enable Register. Each Status Byte summary bit is logically ANDed to the
corresponding enable bit of the Service Request Enable Register. When you set a Service Request Enable Register bit, and the corresponding summary bit is set in the Status Byte, the RQS/MSS bit of the Status Byte will be set, which in turn sets the Service
Request hardware line on the bus.
6.2.4.6 Reading Registers
You can read any register in the status system using the appropriate query command.
Some registers clear when read, others do not (section 6.2.4.8). The response to a
query will be a decimal value that corresponds to the binary-weighted sum of all bits
in the register (TABLE 6-2). The actual query commands are described later throughout section 6.2.4.

6.2.4.7 Programming Registers
The only registers that may be programmed by the user are the enable registers. All
other registers in the status system are read-only registers. To program an enable 
register, send a decimal value that corresponds to the desired binary-weighted sum
of all bits in the register (TABLE 6-2). The actual commands are described throughout
(section 6.2.4).

6.2.5 Status System
Detail: Status Register
Sets

As shown in FIGURE 6-1, there are two register sets in the status system of the
Model 350: Standard Event Status Register and Operation Event Register.
6.2.5.1 Standard Event Status Register Set
The Standard Event Status Register reports the following interface related instrument events: power on detected, command syntax errors, command execution errors,
query errors, operation complete. Any or all of these events may be reported in the
standard event summary bit through the enable register (FIGURE 6-2). The Standard
Event Status Enable command (*ESE) programs the enable register and the query
command (*ESE?) reads it. *ESR? reads and clears the Standard Event Status Register.
The used bits of the Standard Event Register are described as follows:
D
D

D

D
D

Power On (PON), Bit (7): this bit is set to indicate an instrument off-on 
transition.
Command Error (CME), Bit (5): this bit is set if a command error has been detected
since the last reading. This means that the instrument could not interpret the
command due to a syntax error, an unrecognized header, unrecognized terminators, or an unsupported command.
Execution Error (EXE), Bit (4): this bit is set if an execution error has been
detected. This occurs when the instrument is instructed to do something not
within its capabilities.
Query Error (QYE), Bit (2): this bit indicates a query error. It occurs rarely and
involves loss of data because the output queue is full.
Operation Complete (OPC), Bit (0): when *OPC is sent, this bit will be set when the
instrument has completed all pending operations. The operation of this bit is not
related to the *OPC? command, which is a separate interface feature
(section 6.2.6.6).

6.2.6 Status System
Detail: Status Byte
Register and Service
Request

As shown in FIGURE 6-1, the Status Byte Register receives the summary bits from the
two status register sets and the message available summary bit from the output 
buffer. The status byte is used to generate a service request (SRQ). The selection of
summary bits that will generate an SRQ is controlled by the Service Request Enable
Register.
6.2.6.1 Status Byte Register
The summary messages from the event registers and output buffer set or clear the
summary bits of the Status Byte Register (FIGURE 6-4). These summary bits are not
latched. Clearing an event register will clear the corresponding summary bit in the
Status Byte Register. Reading all messages in the output buffer, including any pending
queries, will clear the message available bit. The bits of the Status Byte Register are
described as follows:
D
D

Operation Summary (OSB), Bit (7): this bit is set when an enabled operation event
has occurred
Request Service (RQS)/Master Summary Status (MSS), Bit (6): this bit is set when a
summary bit and the summary bit’s corresponding enable bit in the Service
Request Enable Register are set. Once set, the user may read and clear the bit in
two different ways, which is why it is referred to as both the RQS and the MSS bit.
When this bit goes from low to high, the Service Request hardware line on the bus
is set; this is the RQS function of the bit (section 6.2.6.3). In addition, the status of
the bit may be read with the *STB? query, which returns the binary weighted sum
of all bits in the Status Byte; this is the MSS function of the bit. 

Performing a serial poll will automatically clear the RQS function, but it will not clear
the MSS function. A *STB? will read the status of the MSS bit (along with all of the
summary bits), but also will not clear it. To clear the MSS bit, either clear the event
register that set the summary bit or disable the summary bit in the 
Service Request Enable Register.
D

Event Summary (ESB), Bit (5): this bit is set when an enabled standard event has

The Service Request Enable Register is programmed by the user and determines
which summary bits of the Status Byte may set bit 6 (RQS/MSS) to generate a Service
Request. Enable bits are logically ANDed with the corresponding summary bits 
(FIGURE 6-4). Whenever a summary bit is set by an event register and its corresponding enable bit is set by the user, bit 6 will set to generate a service request. The Service
Request Enable command (*SRE) programs the Service Request Enable Register and
the query command (*SRE?) reads it.

6.2.6.3 Using Service Request (SRQ) and Serial Poll
When a Status Byte summary bit (or MAV bit) is enabled by the Service Request
Enable Register and goes from 0 to 1, bit 6 (RQS/MSS) of the status byte will be set.
This will send a service request (SRQ) interrupt message to the bus controller. The
user program may then direct the bus controller to serial poll the instruments on the
bus to identify which one requested service (the one with bit 6 set in its status byte).
Serial polling will automatically clear RQS of the Status Byte Register. This allows subsequent serial polls to monitor bit 6 for an SRQ occurrence generated by other event
types. After a serial poll, the same event or any event that uses the same Status Byte
summary bit, will not cause another SRQ unless the event register that caused the
first SRQ has been cleared, typically by a query of the event register.
The serial poll does not clear MSS. The MSS bit stays set until all enabled Status Byte
summary bits are cleared, typically by a query of the associated event register 
(section 6.2.6.4).
The programming example in TABLE 6-4 initiates an SRQ when a command error is
detected by the instrument.

6.2.6.4 Using Status Byte Query (*STB?)
The Status Byte Query (*STB?) command is similar to a serial poll except it is processed like any other instrument command. The *STB? command returns the same
result as a serial poll except that the Status Byte bit 6 (RQS/MSS) is not cleared. In this
case, bit 6 is considered the MSS bit. Using the *STB? command does not clear any bits
in the Status Byte Register.
6.2.6.5 Using the Message Available (MAV) Bit
Status Byte summary bit 4 (MAV) indicates that data is available to read into the bus
controller. This message may be used to synchronize information exchange with the
bus controller. The bus controller can, for example, send a query command to the
Model 350 and then wait for MAV to set. If the MAV bit has been enabled to initiate an
SRQ, the user’s program can direct the bus controller to look for the SRQ leaving the
bus available for other use. The MAV bit will be clear whenever the output buffer is
empty.
6.2.6.6 Using Operation Complete (*OPC) and Operation Complete Query (*OPC?)
The Operation Complete (*OPC) and Operation Complete Query (*OPC?) are both
used to indicate when pending device operations complete. However, the commands
operate with two distinct methods.
The *OPC command is used in conjunction with bit 0 (OPC) of the Standard Event Status Register. If *OPC is sent as the last command in a command sequence, bit 0 will be
set when the instrument completes the operation that was initiated by the command
sequence. Additional commands may be sent between the instrument and the bus
controller while waiting for the initial pending operation to complete. A typical use of
this function would be to enable the OPC bit to generate an SRQ and include the *OPC
command when programming the instrument. The bus controller could then be
instructed to look for an SRQ allowing additional communication with the instrument while the initial process executes.
The *OPC? query has no interaction with bit 0 (OPC) of the Standard Event Status Register. If the *OPC? query is sent at the end of a command sequence, the bus will be
held until the instrument completes the operation that was initiated by the command sequence. Additional commands (except *RST) should not be sent until the
operation is complete, as erratic operation will occur. Once the sequence is complete
a 1 will be placed in the output buffer. This function is typically used to signal a completed operation without monitoring the SRQ. It is also used when it is important to
prevent any additional communication on the bus during a pending operation.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

6.3 USB Interface

The Model 350 USB interface provides a convenient way to connect to most modern
computers, as a USB interface is provided on nearly all new PCs as of the writing of
this manual. The USB interface is implemented as a virtual serial com port connection. This implementation provides a simple migration path for modifying existing
RS-232 based remote interface software. It also provides a simpler means of communicating than a standard USB implementation.

6.3.1 Physical
Connection

The Model 350 has a B-type USB connector on the rear panel. This is the standard
connector used on USB peripheral devices, and it allows the common USB A-type to
B-type cable to be used to connect the Model 350 to a host PC. The pin assignments
for A-type and B-type connectors are shown in section 8.10. The maximum length of a
USB cable, as defined by the USB 2.0 standard, is 5 m (16.4 ft). This length can be
extended using USB hubs every 5 m (16.4 ft) up to five times, for a maximum total 
length of 30 m (98.4 ft).

6.3.2 Hardware
Support

The USB interface emulates an RS-232 serial port at a fixed 57,600 baud rate, but
with the physical connections of a USB. This programming interface requires a certain configuration to communicate properly with the Model 350. The proper configuration parameters are listed in TABLE 6-5.

The USB hardware connection uses the full speed (12,000,000 bits/sec) profile of the
USB 2.0 standard; however, since the interface uses a virtual serial com port at a fixed
data rate, the data throughput is still limited to a baud rate of 57,600 bits/s.

6.3.4 Communication

Communicating via the USB interface is done using message strings. The message
strings should be carefully formulated by the user program according to some simple
rules to establish effective message flow control.

| www.lakeshore.com

120

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

6.3.4.1 Character Format
A character is the smallest piece of information that can be transmitted by the interface. Each character is ten bits long and contains data bits, bits for character timing,
and an error detection bit. The instrument uses seven bits for data in the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. One start bit and one stop
bit are necessary to synchronize consecutive characters. Parity is a method of error
detection. One parity bit configured for odd parity is included in each character.
ASCII letter and number characters are used most often as character data. Punctuation characters are used as delimiters to separate different commands or pieces of
data. A special ASCII character, line feed (LF 0AH), is used to indicate the end of a message string. This is called the message terminator. The Model 350 will accept either
the line feed character alone, or a carriage return (CR 0DH) followed by a line feed as
the message terminator. The instrument query response terminator will include both
carriage return and line feed.
6.3.4.2 Message Strings
A message string is a group of characters assembled to perform an interface function.
There are three types of message strings: commands, queries, and responses. The
computer issues command and query strings through user programs, the instrument
issues responses. Two or more command or query strings can be chained together in
one communication, but they must be separated by a semi-colon (;). The total communication string must not exceed 255 characters in length.
A command string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to perform
a function or change a parameter setting. The format is:
<command mnemonic><space><parameter data><terminators>.
Command mnemonics and parameter data necessary for each one is described in 
section 6.6. Terminators must be sent with every message string.
A query string is issued by the computer and instructs the instrument to send a
response. The query format is:
<query mnemonic><?><space><parameter data><terminators>.
Query mnemonics are often the same as commands with the addition of a question
mark. Parameter data is often unnecessary when sending queries. Query mnemonics
and parameter data if necessary is described in section 6.6. Terminators must be sent
with every message string. The computer should expect a response very soon after a
query is sent.
A response string is the instrument’s response or answer to a query string. The
response can be a reading value, status report or the present value of a parameter.
Response data formats are listed along with the associated queries in section 6.6. The
response is sent as soon as possible after the instrument receives the query.

6.3.5 Message Flow
Control

It is important to remember that the user program is in charge of the USB communication at all times. The instrument cannot initiate communication, determine which
device should be transmitting at a given time, or guarantee timing between messages. All of this is the responsibility of the user program.
When issuing commands the user program alone should:
D
D
D

Model 350 Temperature Controller

Properly format and transmit the command including the terminator as 1 string
Guarantee that no other communication is started for 50 ms after the last character is transmitted
Not initiate communication more than 20 times per second

6.4 Ethernet Interface

121

When issuing queries or queries and commands together, the user program should:
D
D
D
D
D

Properly format and transmit the query including the terminator as 1 string
Prepare to receive a response immediately
Receive the entire response from the instrument including the terminator
Guarantee that no other communication is started during the response or for
50 ms after it completes
Not initiate communication more than 20 times per second

Failure to follow these simple rules will result in inability to establish communication
with the instrument or intermittent failures in communication.

6.4 Ethernet
Interface

The Ethernet interface provides a means of connecting the Model 350 to an Ethernet
based computer network. Ethernet networks provide the ability to communicate
across large distances, often using existing equipment (the internet, pre-existing
local networks). The Ethernet interface of the Model 350 provides the ability to use
TCP socket connections (section 6.4.3) to send commands and queries to the instrument using the common command set detailed in section 6.6. The Model 350 has an
embedded web interface that provides status information and 
additional utilities (section 6.5).
Menu Navigation:
InterfaceQEnabledQEthernet

6.4.1 Ethernet
Configuration

There are several parameters for configuring the Model 350 Ethernet interface and
three methods for configuring these parameters. This section contains a brief explanation of each of these. A comprehensive discussion of computer networking is
beyond the scope of this manual. These settings may depend on your network configuration; contact your network administrator for assistance.
6.4.1.1 Network Address Parameters
Network address parameters include the IP address, the subnet mask, and the gateway address. The network address parameters of the Model 350 can be configured
using one of three methods: DHCP, Auto-IP, or Static-IP. See section 6.4.1.2 for details
on each of these configuration methods.
D

IP Address: an IP address is required for a device to communicate using TCP/IP,
which is the protocol generally used for Ethernet devices and the Model 350. The
IP version used by the Model 350 is IPv4. The IPv6 standard is not supported. All
references to the IP protocol from this point forward will be referring to IPv4.

An IP address is a 32-bit logical address used to differentiate devices on a network. It is most often given in dotted decimal notation, such as nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
where nnn is a decimal number from 0 to 255.

D

Subnet Mask: a sub network, or subnet, is a group of devices within a network that
have a common, designated IP address routing prefix. A subnet mask is a 32-bit
“bit mask” that signifies which part of the IP address represents the subnet routing prefix, and which part represents the device’s address on the subnet. A subnet
mask is most often given in dotted decimal notation, such as nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
where nnn is a decimal number from 0 to 255. When converted to a binary notation, the 32-bit subnet mask should consist of a contiguous group of ones, followed by a contiguous group of zeros. The ones represent which bits in the IP
address refer to the subnet, and the zeros represent which bits refer to the device
address. For example, the default Static-IP Address of the Model 350 is
192.168.0.12, and the default Static Subnet Mask is 255.255.255.0. Converting
this subnet mask to binary shows that the first 24 bits are ones, and the last 8 bits

| www.lakeshore.com

122

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

are zeros. This means that the first 24 bits of the Static-IP Address (192.168.0)
represent the subnet, and the last 8 bits (12) represent the device.
D

Gateway Address: a gateway is a network traffic routing device that is used to route
communication between networks. If a gateway is not used, then devices on a
network can only communicate with other devices on that same network. A
Gateway Address is the IP address of the gateway on a network. Contact the network administrator for the gateway address for your network.

6.4.1.2 Network Address Configuration Methods
The network address parameters of the Model 350 can be configured using one of
three methods: DHCP, Auto-IP, or Static-IP. DHCP and Auto-IP are automatic configuration methods, and Static-IP requires manual configuration. If supported by the
server, DHCP can also be used to automatically configure DNS server addresses, as
well as IP address parameters.
An order of precedence is followed when the Model 350 attempts to acquire IP
address parameters. If enabled, the DHCP method will be used first. If DHCP is disabled, or if the attempt to acquire parameters from the DHCP server fails, the
Model 350 then checks if Auto-IP is enabled. If Auto-IP is enabled, this method will be
used. If disabled, or if this attempt fails, the Static-IP method will be used. If the
Static-IP method fails, the IP address parameters will not be configured and the
Ethernet status will enter an error state. Refer to section 6.4.2.1 if you receive an error
message.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): DHCP is a method of automatically configuring the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of Ethernet devices on a network. This
method provides simple automatic configuration for users connecting to a network
that provides a DHCP server. The network DHCP server will provide an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address. Depending on the DHCP server configuration, it may
also provide primary DNS and secondary DNS addresses as well. DHCP is the simplest
method of IP configuration. DHCP does have the disadvantage of not necessarily preserving the IP address through a device reconfiguration, as well as the possibility of
being automatically reconfigured when the DHCP “lease” expires. Contact your network administrator to find out the DHCP lease policy on your network.
To use DHCP to automatically configure the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of
the Model 350, simply connect the Model 350 to a network that provides a DHCP
server, and set the DHCP parameter to On. By default, the DHCP feature of the
Model 350 is On.
Menu Navigation:
Interface QModify IP ConfigQDHCPQ(Off or On)
Auto-IP: Auto-IP is a method of automatically configuring the IP address and subnet
mask parameters of Ethernet devices on a link-local network. This configuration is
performed by the Model 350 and does not require any external device. Auto-IP is
defined in RFC 3927 “Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses” and can
be found at The Internet Engineering Task Force website at www.ietf.org. The automatically configured address will be in the link-local address group of 169.254.1.0 to
169.254.254.255. This group is reserved for independent, local networks that do not
connect to other networks. This method chooses an IP address that is not already
active on the network, which eliminates IP address conflicts. A gateway address is not
applicable when using Auto-IP, since the purpose of a gateway address is to 

Model 350 Temperature Controller

6.4.1 Ethernet Configuration

123

communicate with outside networks, and by definition Auto-IP only works on linklocal networks. A disadvantage of Auto-IP is the limitation of only working with a linklocal network, which cannot connect to other networks, including the internet.
Another disadvantage lies in the fact that an Auto-IP assigned address will not be preserved through a device reconfiguration, such as a power cycle.
To use Auto-IP to automatically configure a link-local IP address and subnet mask, set
the DHCP parameter to Off, then set the Auto-IP parameter to On. By default, the
Auto-IP feature of the Model 350 is Off.
Menu Navigation:
Interface QModify IP ConfigQAuto-IP Q(Off or On)
Static-IP: Static-IP is a method of manually configuring the IP address, subnet mask,
and gateway of Ethernet enabled devices. When using the Static-IP method, the IP
address, subnet mask, and gateway must be configured appropriately for the connected network, or for the connected PC, in order to establish connection to the network. A major advantage to the Static-IP method is that the IP address will not
change during device reconfiguration (power cycle). Disadvantages of using the
Static-IP method include the requirement of knowing how your network is configured in order to choose the correct configuration parameters.
The Static-IP method is always enabled, and therefore will default to this method
when both automatic configuration methods (DHCP and Auto-IP) are disabled, or if
all enabled automatic configuration methods fail. To use Static-IP to manually configure the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of the Model 350, set the DHCP and the
Auto-IP parameters to Off. Refer to the paragraphs above for details on turning off
DHCP and Auto-IP. The Model 350 will now use the Static-IP Address, Static Subnet
Mask, Static Gateway, Static Primary DNS, and Static Secondary DNS parameters to
attempt to configure the Ethernet interface connection. Refer to section 6.4.1.3 for
details on DNS parameters. Contact your network administrator for the appropriate
Static-IP parameters for your network.

6.4.1.3 DNS Parameters
The parameters discussed in this section exist to facilitate the use of the Domain
Name System (DNS) to connect to the Model 350 using assignable names rather than
cryptic IP addresses. This functionality is provided for convenience only, and is not
critical to the connectivity of the Ethernet interface.
DNS Address: A Domain Name System (DNS) is a service that translates names into IP
addresses. This service allows for using human readable names for devices on a network. As an example, when a web browser attempts to retrieve the web page at
www.lakeshore.com, the browser first performs a forward-lookup on the assigned
DNS server to attempt to retrieve the IP address that is represented by the name
www.lakeshore.com. If successful, the web browser then uses the retrieved IP address
to communicate with the web server that hosts the website at www.lakeshore.com.

124

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

The Model 350 can be configured to communicate with a primary and a secondary
DNS server using the Primary DNS Address and the Secondary DNS Address parameters. Multiple DNS servers are sometimes used for redundancy, but multiple servers
are not required, and not all networks provide a DNS server. DNS addresses can be
configured automatically using the DHCP method if the network DHCP server is configured to do so.
Your DHCP server must be configured appropriately to provide DNS server addresses. Not
all DHCP servers provide this functionality on your network.

Hostname: A hostname is a name that is assigned to a device on a network. On a
Domain Name System (DNS) enabled network, a hostname can be used alone when
connecting from another device on the same domain, or it can be combined with a
domain name to connect to devices outside of the local domain. For example,
www.lakeshore.com refers to the Lake Shore web server on the Internet, which is a
DNS enabled network. The web server hostname is “www”, and it resides on the
domain “lakeshore.com”. To connect to the web server from another device on the
lakeshore.com domain, only the hostname “www” must be used. To connect from any
other domain on the Internet, the entire fully-qualified name, consisting of the hostname and the domain name (www.lakeshore.com) must be used. Hostnames can
only contain alpha-numeric characters and hyphens, but cannot begin or end with a
hyphen.
A hostname can be assigned by a network administrator, or if the Model 350 is connected to a network with Dynamic DNS (DDNS) capability, a DNS entry is automatically created for it using the Preferred Hostname and Preferred Domain Name
parameters and the assigned IP address.
Menu Navigation:
InterfaceQModify IP Config QPreferred HostnameQ(Valid Hostname String)
If DNS reverse-lookup is enabled on the network DNS server, and the DNS address
parameters are correctly configured, the Model 350 will perform a reverse-lookup to
determine if a hostname is assigned for the Model 350’s configured IP address. This
will occur regardless of whether the hostname was configured dynamically using
DDNS, or manually by the network administrator. The returned hostname will appear
in the Actual Hostname parameter, in the View IP Config submenu of the Interface
Setup menu.
Menu Navigation (Read Only):
Interface QView IP Config QActual Hostname
When using naming systems other than DNS, the Model 350 cannot assign the Preferred
Hostname or retrieve the Actual Hostname.

Domain Name: A domain is a collection of network devices that are managed according
to some common characteristic of its members. Domains can contain subdomains
which are subsets within the domain. The hierarchy can contain several dot separated levels which flow from right to left. For example, lakeshore.com contains the
top-level-domain “com” and the subdomain “lakeshore”. When using the Domain
Name System (DNS) to connect to a specific host device on a network, the device's
hostname is tacked onto the left of the domain name. For example, the “www” in
www.lakeshore.com refers to the Lake Shore web server, located within the internet
domain “lakeshore.com.”

If the Model 350 is connected to a network with Dynamic DNS (DDNS) capability, a
DNS entry is automatically created using the Preferred Hostname and Preferred
Domain Name parameters and the assigned IP address. The Preferred Domain Name
parameter can only be accessed using the NET interface command (section 6.6.1), or
by using the Ethernet configuration page (section 6.4.2) of the embedded website on
the Model 350.
If DNS reverse-lookup is enabled on the network DNS server, and the DNS address
parameters are correctly configured, the Model 350 will perform a reverse-lookup to
determine if a domain name is assigned for the Model 350’s configured IP address.
This will occur regardless of whether the domain name was configured dynamically
using DDNS, or manually by the network administrator. The returned domain name
will appear in the Actual Hostname parameter, in the View IP Config submenu of the
Interface Setup menu.
When using naming systems other than DNS, the Model 350 cannot assign the Preferred
Domain Name or retrieve the Actual Domain Name.

Menu Navigation:
The Preferred Domain name can only be entered using a computer interface NET
command, and viewed using the NET? query. Refer to section 6.6.1 for details on the
NET command and query.

6.4.2 Viewing Ethernet
Configuration

When the Ethernet interface is enabled, two submenus become available: Modify IP
Config, and View IP Config. All configurable settings are available under the Modify IP
Config submenu, and the current state of the Ethernet configuration is detailed in the
View IP Config submenu. This is designed to eliminate confusion as to which are the
configurable Static-IP settings, and which are the currently configured settings that
could have been configured using any of the three configuration methods (DHCP,
Auto-IP, or Static-IP). The method used for the currently established connection is
shown in the LAN Status parameter of the View IP Confi submenu (section 6.4.2.1).
6.4.2.1 LAN Status
The LAN Status parameter indicates the current status of the Ethernet configuration.
This read-only parameter can be accessed using the View IP Config menu.
The possible LAN Status states are:

Addr Not Acquired: the IP address parameters were not successfully configured.
Duplicate Init IP: when initially attempting to connect to the network, the StaticIP address was found to be in use by another device already configured on the
network. The Model 350 interface will remain unconfigured until an available
Static-IP address is entered.
Duplicate Ong IP: an ongoing conflict occurred after being successfully connected to the network, because another device on the network was configured
using the same IP address. The Model 350 will automatically unconfigure and
remain unconfigured until an available IP address is entered.

6.4.2.2 MAC Address
The Media Access Controller (MAC) Address is a physical hardware address assigned
to all Ethernet devices. MAC addresses are 48-bits and are generally written as six
groups of two hexidecimal digits separated by colons, for example
“01:23:45:67:89:AB”. Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses are tied to the device hardware and cannot be changed.

6.4.3 TCP Socket
Communication

A TCP socket connection interface is provided as the communication medium for the
Ethernet interface of the Model 350. A TCP socket connection, or simply “socket connection”, is a common connection protocol used by Ethernet devices. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is commonly used for creating a communication channel
between one program on one computer and one program on another computer, for
example a web browser on a PC and a web server on the Internet. In the case of the
Model 350, the protocol is used to create a communication channel between one
program on one computer and the command line interface of the Model 350. TCP
uses error correction and collision avoidance schemes that make it a very reliable
form of Ethernet communication, but has drawbacks of having nondeterministic timing, and can encounter relatively large delays depending on network conditions.
These delays can be on the order of seconds. Sockets use port numbers to identify
sending and receiving endpoints on network devices. This allows for multiple separate communication links to exist on each device. The port number used for TCP socket
connections on the Model 350 is 7777.
A maximum of two simultaneous socket connections can be made to the Model 350. Any
attempts to open a new socket while two socket connections are already open on a
Model 350 will fail.

6.4.4 Embedded Web Interface

6.4.4 Embedded Web
Interface

127

The Model 350 provides a web interface via an embedded web server that runs on the
instrument. Once the Model 350 is properly connected, and the IP parameters properly configured, the web interface can be opened using a web browser. The web interface should be accessible using any modern web browser, but has only been tested
with Microsoft™ Internet Explorer version 6.0 and 7.0.
6.4.4.1 Connecting to the Web Interface
To connect to the web interface, type “http://” followed by the IP address assigned to
the Model 350 that you are attempting to connect to. If connecting from a device on
the same local network, and a hostname is properly assigned to the Model 350 via a
naming service on the network (section 6.4.1.3), then the IP address can be replaced
by the hostname. If connecting from a device not on the same local network, but on a
network which is connected to the local network of the Model 350, and a hostname
and a domain name are properly assigned, the IP address can be replaced by the hostname followed by the domain name, with a dot separator between them. For example if the hostname LSCI-3500001, and the domain name yourdomain.com were
assigned via a naming service, then typing “http://LSCI-3500001.yourdomain.com”
would open the home web page of the Model 350 embedded website.
6.4.4.2 Web Pages
Each web page contains detailed help information in the form of tool-tips. You can
access these tool-tips by hovering the mouse pointer over the various help icons
(show help icon image here) located throughout the embedded website.

6.5 Utilities

The utilities embedded on the Model 350 are written using the Java™ programming
language. This theoretically allows the applications to run properly on many different
platforms (Windows®, Mac®, Linux™, etc.), although the applications are only supported on Microsoft Windows® XP or Windows Vista®, and have been designed to
work with the Java™ Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6. To download Java ™ JRE
please visit www.java.com.
Please note that without the proper JRE installed the utilities will not run properly.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

The applications are launched from the Utilities web page using Java™ Web Start
technology. This allows the application to run outside of the web browser in a standalone window. The application can only be launched using the link in the embedded
web page, and cannot be permanently installed. When launching the application,
multiple security warning messages may appear. These messages are meant to protect youfrom malicious software that can cause harm to, or compromise the security
of, your computer or your data. The applications have been thoroughly tested and are
considered by Lake Shore to be safe.
All software is imperfect and any software may be used by a malicious user for malicious
purposes.

6.5.1 Embedded
Curve Handler™

The Embedded Curve Handler™ utility is provided for uploading temperature curve
files to the Model 350. The utility is also capable of reading curves from the
Model 350 and writing them to a file for storage, or manipulation in a third party program. The Embedded Curve Handler™ supports standard Lake Shore temperature
curve files in the “.340” file format, and the Microsoft Excel® ".XLS" (Excel® 97 - 2003)
file format. Curve files are provided with calibrated sensors purchased from
Lake Shore in the “.340” file format.

To read a temperature curve from a file: click Read from File. Select a properly formatted temperature curve (*.340 or *.XLS) file using the Open Browser dialog box. The
curve will be loaded into the program and the curve points and graph will be displayed.

To read a temperature curve from the Model 350: click Read from Instrument. The
Read Curve from Instrument dialog box appears. Select a curve from the drop-down
box and click OK. The curve will be loaded into the program and the curve points and
graph will be displayed.
Once a curve is loaded into the Embedded Curve Handler™ using either the Read
from File or Read from Instrument buttons, the loaded curve can be stored either to a
user curve location (21 to 59) in the Model 350, or to a file.
To store the curve to a user curve location in the Model 350: click Write to Instrument. The Write Curve to Instrument dialog box appears. Select a user curve location
to write the loaded temperature curve to, and click OK.

To write the currently loaded curve to a file: click Write to File. A Save Browser dialog
box appears. First use the Files of Type drop-down box to select the file format in
which to save the curve. Then choose a directory and a file name, and click Save .
The .340 file format is an ASCII text file which can be read and altered using a standard ASCII text editor. Care must be taken when altering the .340 text files to ensure
that all of the values are stored in the same position in the file as the original values,
using the same number of digits. To alter curve files, it is recommended to use the .XLS
file format, which can be altered using Microsoft Excel®. If using formulas to alter
curves, you must copy the results of the formulas and paste them back into the original cells of the breakpoint values. The Embedded Curve Handler™ cannot interpret
formulas in cells. In most versions of Excel®, this can be done by copying the formula
results, then pasting them in the appropriate cells using the Paste Special command,
and selecting Paste Values. Refer to the appropriate Microsoft Excel® documentation
for details on the Paste Special operation.

The embedded chart recorder utility is provided to allow users to easily acquire and
chart data from the Model 350. The chart recorder utility can simultaneously chart
and log any combination of sensor readings, control setpoints, and heater output
data from the Model 350. A basic user interface is also provided for changing control
parameters on the fly while acquiring data, allowing many basic experiments to be
performed without ever having to write any custom software. Log files are stored in
the Microsoft Excel® .xls format for easy data manipulation. Free utilities are available online for converting .xls files to comma separated plain text files (.csv) if Microsoft Excel is not available.

cHAPTER 6: Computer Interface Operation

The configuration panel can be collapsed to increase the size of the chart. To collapse
the configuration panel, simply click on Collapse configuration panel (12). When collapsed, the same button becomes an Expand Configuration Panel button that can be
used to restore the configuration panel on the form. When data acquisition is in progress, the configuration panel controls are disabled, but the current settings can still
be seen.
6.5.4.2 Starting Data Acquisition
Once the parameters in the configuration panel are set as desired, simply click Start
to begin data acquisition. If you are logging data to a file, the Number of Data Points
to Log parameter is used to determine how many data points to take before terminating data acquisition. However, once data acquisition has begun, the Start button
becomes a Stop button, and data acquisition can be terminated by pressing Stop button. If you are not logging to a file, data acquisition will continue until you press Stop.
6.5.4.3 Chart Functionality
By default, the chart (6), will autoscale in both the x and y-axis. The time scale slider
(7) is provided to adjust the time scale window (x-axis scaling). When less than one
hour of data has been logged, the slider will allow a time window between 1 and 60
min, in increments of 1 min. As the total elapsed time increases, the values on the
time scale slider will also increase to allow time windows proportional to the elapsed
time. A y-axis is added for each unique measurement unit of the selected readings.
Each y-axis will be autoscaled, so if more than one reading is being taken in the same
unit, the scale for the associated axis will be set such that the largest values of all
readings are at the extremes. Data that is charted on the same axis, but that is far
apart in magnitude, will result in low resolution for each data series.
Manual zooming of the chart can be achieved either by using the mouse wheel, or by
clicking and dragging a box around the area of the chart to zoom to. Manual panning
can be achieved by holding the Ctrl key, then clicking and dragging the chart. After
manually zooming or panning, autoscaling in both axes is turned off and Reset Zoom/
Pan becomes active. To return to autoscale mode, click Reset Zoom/Pan.
A screenshot of the currently displayed chart can be copied to the clipboard, saved in
the PNG image format, or printed directly to a printer using the context menu that
appears when right clicking on the chart. Other chart properties, such as colors and
fonts can be customized through this context menu by clicking Properties. Note that
changes to these chart properties are not saved when the application is closed, so the
default values will be restored when reopening the chart recorder utility.
6.5.4.4 Utilities Panel
The utilities panel (11) provides added functionality to assist the user in various common tasks associated with user applications. Three tabs provide a means of selecting
between the three utili-ties.

8.11 Electrostatic
Discharge

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) may damage electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment. ESD is a transfer of electrostatic charge between bodies at different electrostatic potentials caused by direct contact or induced by an electrostatic field. The
low-energy source that most commonly destroys Electrostatic Discharge sensitive
devices is the human body, which generates and retains static electricity. Simply
walking across a carpet in low humidity may generate up to 35,000 V of 
static electricity.
Current technology trends toward greater complexity, increased packaging density,
and thinner dielectrics between active elements, which results in electronic devices
with even more ESD sensitivity. Some electronic parts are more ESD sensitve than
others. ESD levels of only a few hundred volts may damage electronic components
such as semiconductors, thick and thin film resistors, and piezoelectric crystals
during testing, handling, repair, or assembly. Discharge voltages below 4000 V cannot
be seen, felt, or heard.

8.11.1 Identification of
Electrostatic Discharge
Sensitive Components

The following are various industry symbols used to label components as 
ESD sensitive.

8.11.2 Handling
Electrostatic Discharge
Sensitive Components

Observe all precautions necessary to prevent damage to ESDS components before
attempting installation. Bring the device and everything that contacts it to ground
potential by providing a conductive surface and discharge paths. As a minimum,
observe these precautions:

8.12 Enclosure Top
Remove and
Replace Procedure

De-energize or disconnect all power and signal sources and loads used with unit.
Place the unit on a grounded conductive work surface.
The technician should be grounded through a conductive wrist strap (or other
device) using 1 M series resistor to protect operator.
Ground any tools, such as soldering equipment, that will contact the unit. Contact with the operator’s hands provides a sufficient ground for tools that are otherwise electrically isolated.
Place ESD sensitive devices and assemblies removed from a unit on a conductive
work surface or in a conductive container. An operator inserting or removing a
device or assembly from a container must maintain contact with a conductive
portion of the container. Use only plastic bags approved for storage of 
ESD material.
Do not handle ESD sensitive devices unnecessarily or remove them from the
packages until they are actually used or tested.

Follow this procedure to remove the top enclosure. The enclosure top remove and
replace procedure if for installing an input option card.

To avoid potentially lethal shocks, turn off the controller and disconnect it from AC power
before performing these procedures.
The components on this board are electrostatic discharge sensitive (ESDS) devices. 
Follow ESD procedures in section 8.11 to avoid inducing an electrostatic discharge (ESD)
into the device.

1. Turn the Model 350 power switch Off. Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet, then from the instrument.
2. Stand the unit on its face. Use a 5/64 in hex driver to remove the four screws on
both sides of the top cover. Loosen the two rear bottom screws (FIGURE 8-10).
